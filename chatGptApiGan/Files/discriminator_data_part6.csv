"This is an essenstial may people disrespect employed students. Students need to be motivated to go to school everyday. This leads to money difficulties or problems that can cause them to work late,miss meals or even live without heat,air conditioners,or electricity.Sometimes parents bring in too little money, other times they get laid off. Most of the time employed students are missing meals because did you them of money but they still have ot help out with bills. They can be feeding their siblings and even paying bills that shout be otay their parents resposibilty.High school students do not wanna feel bad though so they do not tell their friends. When you are a high school student you needs friends to make it by great and this cause them to keep it a secret.  The first cause of employed students missing meals is that their parents take money out of their check affecting the child. Writing checks for rent, watr, light, and gas would make the child miss a meal. The would not be at home in time to get the checkle cutting most of Tv to get after school meals. So the only way left for them to get a meal would be at school but by them being an emplyed student they dont pay for their meals because they do not qualify for free or reduced breakfast. Most employed students even have to take that burden of having to supply all of their other school supplies. It is illegal for students under the age of sixteex to work on any night in the middle of a school week. From monday to friday but the hours on monday to friday from six a.m. to six p.m. you can work but you would still have to followall child labor laws. Employment certifcation is required for all fifteen and sixteeen year old unless they are working for their parent. Ages seventeen and eighteen do not have to have an employment certifcation unlessthey play football. Students that work at your favorite place,cinma or even your local fast food restaurant often do without meals.The child is missin a meal because they might have been working a late shift and the time that the take to get off is to late to get food at school.To fix that problem writting a check for lunch would be great but most of the students cannot afford to buy lunch each and everyday. To fix this problem they would have to eat breakfast at school , pack lunch, fin somehere to get supper and would probably not get a snack until they got back to their job. By the time they get the check for all of that their would be no way that they could get in line with whats on their check.

"The author of this article has some really good points on how the Facial Action Coding System is useful for the students in the classroom. Even though the computers could tell you how another person is feeling you could also do the same with your closest frineds and family because you kmow them so well. The computers have no idea who you are but they still know what emotion you are feeling just by how the bones in your face are working together.

The computer will form a 3-D model of the face. All of the 44 major muscles have to work exactly like the human muscles in the model. They have classified six basic emotions such as: happiness, surprise, disgust, anger, sadness, and fear. Most people like to hide their emotions with thier face so people don't know that something is wrong. The computer could see right through that and see exactly what emotion is going on.

In the classroom students that are shy or don't ask for help often lie to their teacher and tell them that they understand exactly whats goingon and exactly what they're doing. If we had those computers in the classrooms then the teachers could help us more by knowing the truth. The teachers could figure out a better way to teach the lesson so the kids are'nt so confused.

These computers could change lives but not many people probably see that since it's just another piece of technology. Imagine using this for someone yu are teaching or explaining something to yoou would want them to learn whatever that is you're helping them with would'nt you? But if that person is scared or shy they wouldn't be so easy to tell you that they don't understand. If we used these computers properly and not just as some toy then we could change how education is taught and it not being so difficult to understand so you could recieve better education quality.

Teachers already try their best to help their students but sometimes it's just more difficult than it seems. Children like to give attitude when not understanding something or when they feel like the teacher is judging them because they don't understand something. When it comes to school and work it's alot of stress and focusing but if teachers had a better way to recognize the emotions of their students it'd be easier for them to help them out instead of leaving them there and not understand anything.

I feel as if teachers would like the idea of having one of these computers in their classroom because not only does it benefit their students but it also benefits them by helping their generation out and not letting their students fail but to become successful. So I think that having these in the classroom would be very valuable and helpful for everyone.",0
"There are countless reasons you should study history. Firstly, history is something to learn from. Going over the past helps us to understand how the world came to be. A similar issue could have happened before, so studying the past will help us handle easy obstacles. We don't recycle events, but we may repeat the solution. For example, you can study how World War I started and ended, and that will give you a general idea of how World War III, if there is one, will start. Secondly, history gives you knowledge about the world. Sometimes, history is a requirement to graduate or pass a certain class. There are history textbooks because of the value of history. Lastly, history is very helpful when it comes to economics. Knowing the history of the stock market and budget plans are helpful to society. You are less likely to become scammed or lose all your money. If you know the history of the world's economy, you may be able to predict how it will change in the future by connecting the past and present. The more you know about history, the broader your imagination becomes. It releases your oppurtunity to tell any made-up story.",1
"The Face on Mars was not made from an ancient alian civilization. We have proof of this because our cameras are ten times sharper than the cameras we had to orginally photograph the face, the shadows just create an illusion that the formation is a face, and the Face on Mars has been confirmed to just be a mesa.

The first photo we had of the Face on Mars was taken in 1976 by Viking 1, which would not have had the most advanced cameras. The photo is blurry and unclear, not a very reliable source to base alien belief on. Even the photo in 1998, ""snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginal Viking phtos."" Compare the photo from 1976 to the photo taken in 2001. The 2001 photo clearly shows that the Face on Mars is in fact not a face at all. Any belief that the Face on Mars was created by aliens should now be wiped away because of how clearly the photo shows that the Face is just a landform.

When the original photos were taken in 1976, there was the illusion that there was a face staring right back at the Viking 1. Shadows around the Face created this illusion that made it look like and Egyptian Pharaoh. When the 1976 photo was released for people to see, the caption read, ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Even the experts immediately recognized the Face on Mars as just a natural landform with shadows.

Though some people believed the Face was an alien artifact, this theory is disproved quickly because in truth the Face on Mars is just a mesa. The Face on Mars is in the area of Mars known as Cydonia. Cydonia is known for having lots of Martian mesas. Martian mesas are very similar to mesas or buttes found in the American West. Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program Jim Garving quotes, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Which is a lava dome the takes the form of an isolated mesa, and is approximately the same hight as the mesa known as the Face on Mars.

Though some theorists still believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, it turns out to be just a Martian equivalent of a mesa. This is proved true by the advanced camera quality, the proof that it was just shadows creating the illusion that the Face on Mars was actually a face, and the fact that the Face has been confirmed to just be a mesa.",0
"There are a few steps of making air conditioned lipstick using scissors, your favorite color lipstick and a small container. First, get a packet and use the scissors to cut it in a straight line across the center end of the packet. Next, use the scissors to cut a small rectangle shape on the top half of the packet you cut off. Then, take your lipstick tube and twist it all the way down, then place the bottom part of the tube into the packet you cut a rectangle on. Finally, twist the lipstick all the way up, fit the top half of the packet back on the bottom half, and enjoy your air conditioned lipstick tube. This shows how your favorite lipstick tube can now be a air conditioned one so you don't have to worry about your lipstick melting or getting damaged.",1
"lmithing car usage is a bad thing or a good thing ? here are some of the reson why i think that limithing car uasge is a good thing to do .

reason one why i think limithing car uasge is that we wont have to pay for gas alot more then we have to casue we wont be usage are cars . some cars got good gas milege but some cars dont have that and we cant forget are diesel trucks owners they dont have good milege and diesel is expensive to its like $100 or more dollars to fill up you diesal truck.

second reson why i think we should limit car uasge is so we wont be lazy go out and go for a walk with your family or a bike ride , hicking also skate something just to enjoy the day and the nice weather . do what BOGOTA, colombia they had a car free day that only buses and taxi where on the road . so they can take the buses or taxi to work or where ever they wanted to go and if you where driving on the street with your car you would be fined $25 . its also good why to take stress away you wont have to worry about being late or being stuck in traffic or you car wont start .

last reson why i think we should limit car usage is that we can lower the air pollution like beijing,china they are know as one of the most polluted cities in the world cause they have some many citizens living there so at least half or more have cars.

thats  why i think we should limit car usage cause we dont have to pay for gas and diesal also so we wont be lazy and get out of the house go out ride a bike, go walking ,skate something to just take away the stress of all the traffic and last be no least so we can lower the air pollition .",0
"Technology How the Boston Bruins Have a Unique Niche to Develop Their Skilled Young Players Technology has brought the skilled knowledge of analyzing players and their progress throughout the season, from shooting, face off percentage, shooting percentage, games played, hits, etc. In chapter 5, “Minor League Front Office Positions,” of the book Sports Analytics Designing, Tracking, & Valuing Player Performance, five authors speak about the process and all the hard work it takes to run a team in the minor leagues. They talk about key jobs such as, Farm Director (General Manager), Assistant Farm Director (Assistant General Manager), Player Development (Head Coach), Strength & Conditioning (Gym Teacher), and the Athletic Trainer (Nurse). The game of Ice Hockey is a unique sport that might go beyond playing games at the collegiate/professional level, but there is always a place for skilled hockey players in this world to remain employed. The Boston Bruins have multiple people who specialize in analytics to help develop the skills of their younger hockey players. One person who stands out the most in the Bruins analytics department is Kayla Frantzis, who is the manager of this department and creates structure for the Bruins to develop and progress. The every day process, which occurs with each player in the organization, is tracking the player through the organization and knowing exactly what the best thing is for that player such as, where is the best league for this player to currently play in, or even as simple as, weight, and height stats are recorded every six months. Technology is essential in the development of these players today because of the hard work and research that is done on each player, to help benefit them in the future to prepare them for the professional leagues of hockey. Technology is a beautiful thing when it comes to analytics for developing specific hockey players, but has it taken developing hockey players and studying the outcomes on the ice too far? There comes a time in everyone’s life where technology can be taken too far. Kayla Frantzis is a very skilled women at what she does, but some might say that recording everything down to the very last bite a player takes, can be too far and even invade a player’s privacy, is that true? Would taking technology completely away from the development process for hockey players slow their progression in this crazy world of always improving technology?

"The Electoral College is a process in which electors pick the president instead of the people, but is it worth keeping. No, the Electoral College is not worth keeping because it reflects the view of the electors instead of the people.

Some people would argue that the Electoral college should be kept because it ensures the certainty of the outcome source 3 paragon 18. However this relies on a winner takes all system which makes the say of the minority voters pointless since even if they do vote then their vote is pointless. Second of all the presidents only campaign in states they are not sure of and completly ignore the states they know they will win source 3 paragraph 19. This may be a good strategy but if we instead abolished the Electoral College then everyones vote would matter and the candidate would have to campaign in every state to ensure his victory. In all the Electoral College should be abolished because it takes away say of the people.

Not only does the Electoral college take away the say of the people, it also has no protection against a tie of states that have an even number of electors source 2 paragraph 11. For instance a state like hawaii that has a total of two electors if they both vote for different people then how are the votes decided well it already happened in 1960,but Richard Nixon who was the vice president at the time and known to be against the Electoral College decided to only aknowledge his opponents electors. That is why we should abolish the Electoral College.

Allow me ask a hypothetical question what if the electors were corrupt and voted for whomever they pleased without even considering the peoples vote source 1 paragraph 2. We have no system to ensure that the people vote matters but the electors does therefore electors that are picked by former candidates may be more likely to return the favor and ignore the peoples vote and vote for their candidate. There are many important figures whom are against the Electoral College such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy carter, and Bob Dale there are many more but thes are all politicians who see the Electoral College the same way the people do source 2 paragraph.

In all the Electoral college should be abolished because it ignores the peoples votes. The votes that werre granted to the people by the constitution therefore the Electoral College not only doesn't care about the people, but it is also violating their constitutional rights.",0
"There have been many amazing advances in technology. In the field of communication new apps and devices are created every day. While some people may think that this is making our society more disconnected because our ""useless"" conversations are moving online, in actuality these are just the opposite. The new advances in technology are making conversation much easier to have, and creating many new ways to learn about and get to know people.

Before the creation of the telephone valuable information was sent via telegraph. This took a lot of time just to send a few works, and they couldn't convey the feelings of those sending the message. Now days all of that time has been cut out, and even with something said offensively if a sincere apology is made right after words can easily be forgiven. Another example of this is the creation of electricity which was a major leap in the technology department. Before electricity the main mode of communication was through the newspaper, which was a very impersonal way of sending messages. Reading about the death of a loved one in the newspaper, or reading about a celebration that someone was not able to attend would have been very hard. I can only imagine how many different illnesses were caused because of how hard it must have been to deliver break up letters in the 1800's.

The person who is credited with the creation of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, says that he did not create facebook as a way for young people to communicate online. His main goal was to create a new way for people to learn about and to get to know people. Even though some people may argue that facbook is indeed making communication worse it in actuality a very helpful tool. Teenagers as well as adults use facebook to keep in contact with friends and family members that are far away, to learn new things about the people around them and to share thier life with others. This proves that although the advances in technology make a great new toy for people to play with thier main purpose is to provide people with a much more efficent way to coomunicate with others. The new advances in technology also allow people to get to know one another so much better. The advances of technology in this day and age have done nothing but make the people better at understanding each other, and the messages that one is trying to convey. #younghuman",1
"In this essay I will be giving an argument on why this so called ""face"" is not made by aliens.

The prompt tells you that one of your colleagues says that it is created by aliens.

My job in this essay is to tell why it isn't and give an explanation.

The figure that NASA saw was a so called ""face on mars"".

They claimed that it was in the shape of a human head and it was thought to be made by aliens.

In my oppinion this is not made by aliens.

Here is a reason why.

All these years NASA has gone to a two or three planets looking for aliens.

Throughout the years how many have we found, none!

Yes, we may have found some traces of aliens, but we can not prove that these are actually alien tracks, or alien lifeforms.

There is no way to prove that this structure was made by aliens, unless we have images of them, and so far we have none.

Look down on earth.

How many mesas or Buttes do we have in America, or even around the world?

Now think about this, were these man made?

No, none of these land formations were man made!

They are formed naturally by nature.

Now over the years we have found a lot of reasons how Mars is sort of like the earth.

It carries water, and it is one of the easiest planets to get to, so if you think about it, Mars could have the same land formations as we do!

Nature is a beautiful thing, and it more than likely made this so called ""face"".

Yes, you may be right in some way.

Yes, we have found traces of aliens over the years.

This COULD have been made by aliens.

Maybe they are trying to connect to other life outside of their planet.

That is the only argument that you have against me.

The argument that isn't even factual.

You are going off of a guess in your mind.

So overall in this essay I have covered three thing.

I have covered my first argument, which is that we have not found aliens even though we have been searching all of these years.

I have covered my second argument, which is that nature has formed many structures like this on earth, it could have been formed out of the land.

And I also covered the rebuttle, which is that there is a possibility that this was built by aliens because we have found traces.

So in conclusion, this structure was not built by humans, this was land made.",0

"In the following ideas and information passage set we see the effects of using cars too much and how limiting our car use can have a huge impact on, not only our environment, but also on cities on people. Limiting our car usage isn't only a thing that the United States has to work on, but we see that Central America and Europe also has to work on it. Limiting our car usage isn't a small issue, but more of a global issue. Over the years we have seen the effects of global warming (something cause by fossil fuels, which is gas coming from our cars) and how they have had an enormous impact on our world. So, why is liming our car usage even remotely important to us?

In the second article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", paragraph 10, the first thing it says is ""After days of near-record pollution.."", well, what does this say about how we're living today? Paris so close to to being on record breaking pollution, not that it's anything to be proud of. But, if that's how much pollution Paris has, which is a famous city for not only being the ""City of Love"", but for also being big, how will every other city's pollution be? Cities have been growing and expanding so much recently, factories are being built and more cars are being sold, how will this help limiting our car usage? If cities keep expanding, we'll just be adding to the pollution that already exists. After a couple decades all the issues we seem to be ignoring will come up and if the problems are bad now, how bad will they be in the future? This isn't just something we can ignore!

Like David Goldberg says in paragraph seven in ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car.."". Why have we been focusing more on a car than on health and medicine and cures for some illnesses? Why is a car so important? Yes it makes going to places much more easier and quicker, but at what cost will we go to to make things easier on us? It isn't jsut about the pollution caused from our cr usage, but it's also about our health. There are fewer and fewer parks by the year because we'd rather have all our tax money go towards roads instead parks. More malls are opening up and more fast food places are opening up on big interstates and highways, and now all we really have to being close to nature is when we pass by the trees near the interstates and highways. We need trees in order to have oxygen, but if all this pollution is slowly killing trees, how much more time do we have left before we realize it's too late to try saving our trees and limiting our car usage? Back then no one really worried much about limiting our car usage and pollution, because it wasn't that bad. Now all you ever really hear is about pollution and how to stop it.

Even though we really have got to start limiting our car usage, there is still hope in lowering and or even stopping pollution. We could start off small, for instance, by having a day where no one is allowed to drive their cars to places or be fined if you do drive, like Bogota, Colombia does in ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"". It must've had a positive effect because it encouraged Cali and Valledupar, two other Colombian cities, to participate in the event as well.",0
"The earth is full of natural wonders that everyone can enjoy and love; one example of this beautiful wonder is the Niagara Falls. These falls can be located on the border of Canada and the United States - improving the Highlands and the Gloucestershire of the United States. Being such a downstream to the crystal-clear and calm-surfaced Lake Erie, it makes the Niagara Falls a endlessly breathtaking and amazing vision to witness - as well as an ordinary visitor in the Canadian River. The Niagara Falls ended up being known as one of the biggest wonders, and attractants to the Navy. The falls are overcome by an extremely enormous measure of water, however are significantly bigger in the fluid sorts of the dampness in the climate Homeopathy Materia Medica  and,, which figure out how to stream down from the countless amount of 118 square miles in the Dakota, as well as possess inferior water supply to the 165 little streams that appear in its district in New York.

The water doesn't really show up blue or valuable stone clear after following the falls as there is a considerable amount of natural material in Designer Clothes such as fallen trees and plants in addition to the passage of petroleum goods and emptying Floor of merchandises in the urban communities the editing of the falls and on the numerous waterways that storm the event does, consequently, there then planet's climate water and provides for the falls what is a coldish nature. Nonetheless, these falls don't generally produce the drinking water that goes to pass through the ages. The Niagara Falls are not just spread one in a million people of the most attractive parts through such parts in the world, but on the other hand is one of mankind's wellsprings in addition to its most tremendous electrical power. As the year goes by, they work to go to and get to be destinations Energy. The electric power that originates from the rushing waters can be utilized for basically anything alongside with the simply energy elixirs, for example, the engine vehicles or the computers turn on the TV Advertisements and heat an turkey supper. Preferred standpoint is also taken of the falls to control the electrical power that can be sold to mechanical people that incorporates a basic measure Ge Home Security System всхоколатки б фродуадушек.. when of us thinks about the Niagara Falls. The Niagara Falls has existed for a long time Date Single Parents there displays that it required to go in size in order to get to its present size.

The falls are magnificent and a breathtaking sight, and they hold a lot of power in them. They are like a gem that is worth millions of dollars; those that visit them beg to no one to tamper with them, look at them from a lowpoint, or laugh at their incomparable beauty.

"Cars have been used for a very long time now and are a revolutionary invention that completely changed the way humans lived, since it became easier to move from one place to another and increase the size of our cities and mobility in general. Automobiles have alwayas been extremly useful and necesary to our society, however, it had too, some significant disadvantages that could have great impact on our lives. Having this clear now we can point ouit tghe advantages of limiting the car usage no matter how hard or difficult it might be to the biggest cities or more developed societies.

It is important to notice an experiment that was conducted in Germany, the city of Vauban was finished in 2006 and it is an example of a ""car-free"" environment with a few exceptions such as the main street and borders, acording to Elizabeth Rosenthal in her article: ""In German Suburbs, Life Goes On Without Cars"". In the passage it is explained how people gave up a certain lifesctyle to participate in this new progect and it proves how limiting the usage of car can create a very succesful and less stresful future. 70% of the population of this city do not own cars, one of them, Heidrum Walter said: ""When I had a car I was aleays tense, I'm much happier this way,"" proving again how advantagous is this experiment.

In the other had, there is France's capital; Paris, which banned driving due to smog. ""Diesel fuel was blamed"" expressed Robert Duffer on his atricle, additionally refering to its use which makes up 67% of the vehicles in France. As a resulf of the fines and free public transpartation on business days the smog cleared enough so part of the ban was rescinded. Another example of the advantages of reducing car usage is how ""its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" added Carlos A. Plaza, a colombian participating in the car-free day that takes place in Bogota every year. This event motivates people not just in the Colombian capital to ride bikes and be healthier but everyone around them, including adjacent southamerican countries. For instance, stadistics talk too, and it is possible that America getting over its obsession with cars, which is amazing news due to the fact that mobiles vehicles represent the second largest source of carbon emissions in America, as discused on ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal.

All in all, limiting car usage - although a difficul decision for most residents of develeped first-worls countries - might just be one of the greatest steps we could take towards helping our envirionment and forging a new society, shaping it a better way, building healthier kids that will excersice and ejoy more the outsides, and that will breathe cleaner, fresher air. We can improve our atmosphere's condition refereing to greenhouse gasses and carbon emissions and in addition, lead out economy a different direction, maybe to a better, improved world and society that does not depend on mechanic vehicles.",0
"I met Judith at my first Happy Feet soccer practice, and when we started talking about school, she told me that she worked at her school newspaper. I was immediatly interested in asking questions about writing articles and what it was like. She told me it was so much fun and almost a breeze because she got to write about obstacles she had overcome when she was younger and how she felt about life. She explained to me that if she couldnt think of a relatable one, she would just take an event in her everyday life ASAP and write it out in a 300-500 word essay. I was really shocked when she told me that they would sometimes break out their essay prompts in the middle of a class period and everyone would begin writing, she looked very upset something that made her happy was not seen as a big deal at that school. She also told me that her superior came in one day and read one of her essays aloud to the class and mentioned that it was excellent work. All I could think is that is what I want to do and although journalism might not pay us as much as we would like, it makes us happy. All I could think of to ask her is ""Do you make money off of this?"". and being the somewhat negative person she is she said probably not but she loved it. That made me want to choose journalism as a possible career even more. It took her forever to get to what her point was but in the end I realized that it will make me happy and that is all that really matters.",1
"The Challenge of Exploring Venus as the author suggested to study is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it can happen. The reason Humens should explore the Unknown Venus is becuase it was the closest planet to Earth terms of density and size. Venus is dangers for a humen to explore but not an unman spacecraft to go near the surface. Venus is tricky and challanging to explore becuase of the high temeratures that average 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the Atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Even though Mercury is the closet to our sun.

On the depths of the surface of Venus there is alot going on, as in erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightign strikes. Scientists are already discussing how to visit the Venus surface which means they also want to explore and study Venus. Venus once have been like Earth-like planet in our solar system. It has some land features if rocky sediment, Valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus is sometimes our nearest option for a planetary visit, given the long time frames of space travel. The Value of returning to venus seems unlikly.

NASA is creating a blimp-like vehicle to hover 30 or more miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. The almost easy task for the vehicle would use solar power becuase the sun would be above it all the time. Even in high altitude the climate is still pretty hot that is around 170 degree Fahrenheit. The downfall to being so high up above 30 or more miles is not much research will go on becuase the limited view we well get. More importantly is that scientist can't get samples of rocks, gases, and anything else since the spacecraft will be high up.

Scientist is now looking at old technology called mechanical computers. The ""old Technology"" uses gear and levers but not electronics at all. Modern computers are more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions. mechanical parts are more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces then a computer. What I think is that Venus is worth the pursuit despite the danger it can bring. Venus does have value to be explored because who doesn't love a challenge? I sure do love a challenge.",0
"When summer hits many people enjoy the hot sun and going on vacations to beaches and warmer climates, but some don't. They don't all have the same bragging rights to soaking up the sun they want. The vacation that I went on this past summer was definitely the best time I ever have had in my life. Going to Hilton Head Island in South Carolina is a dream come true to anyone, and it was a dream come true to me that's for sure.

To me, this dream vacation was not worth the excitement that was coming to me ahead. It was my first day of summer, and I was ready to start this hot and the blazing vacation filled with the joy of my friends. I was excited to see what God was going to bring to me through this vacation and how He was going to teach me new things, make friends, and how He was going to work in the hearts of my friends. I didn't want this vacation to just be a vacation that I list down as one of my most fun summers, or trips that I went on but I wanted it to be a time when I grew closer to our king. I wanted the Lord to use my heart to be able to help my friends, and for us to be able to experience him in a new way by being so close of friends.

This vacation I discovered a lot about myself. I am a really big people person, and this was a slight problem to me when I was there. I defiantly love to serve and talk to all different types of people but when it is only me, and the people that I go on vacations with it is really hard for me to control my tongue. I wasn't gory during this trip no, however I did a lot of talking when I didn't need to be talking. This is still considered pg for someone in my position because when with my group of friends I still have to be an example for them.

These young ladies taught me so much throughout this trip. One of the biggest things was to love. These little 6th graders love with everything in them. They love people around them, their friends, themenn of their family, and prima me of God with all their hearts. The Lord really showed me that this is th way to be, and that loving people includes a lot more then juicing people with the love notes and letters. The sacrament of true love is in serving others over yourself, and that when you truly care for people as the lord tell you to so many things will fall into place. That your love life isn't you but it is Christ and berries love life is you as his child. They showed me this by never treating another the way he treated someone there, and by being his child in all that that means whether anyone would see it or not. They taught me some good love examples to look at and evaluate when thinking of my own life.",1
"Have you ever wishes you could read the emotions of another person? With new technology created by Thomas Huang you can do just that. This device allows you to precicly calculate the emotions and feelings of anoother person. But would it be valuable in a classroom of students.

In my personal opinion i say yes it would be valuable. I think it would not only be valuable to students but also to teachers. It would be helpfull to students because say for example you have a crush on a fellow classmate but dosent know how she feels about you with a app called snapchat you are able to communicate through pictures, so if you knew how she felt about the conversation based on the selfie she sent it would give you a accurate idea of how she feels about you. A reason i think it would be helpfull to teachers is it would allow them to know when a kid becomes bored or sleepy ultimatly helping on how to teach and what subjects catches your class attention.

So do i think that it is a good idea to have a emotion detector in a classroom. Over all yes because it has it's pro's such ass helping a student with his crush or helping a teacher deliver a lesson planor know when a student it sleeping. But it can also have its con's. So when deciding to put one in a classroom of your own dont only look at the neggatives or posotives but compare and see which outways the other.",0
"The fact that some people misunderstand that stretch the petty budget the teachers have is going too far by using cropped vests as an excuse to stretch that limit. Sports should be part of the curriculum because it teaches teamwork, prunes obesity, and reduces harmful behavior. Although the budget may be a petite one, sports are a perfect way to carry out these three task.

Sports teach teamwork, self-discipline, and accountability. These character treats are all terms of students building a bright future. Students need to learn to collaborate with others in order to get jobs, and these traits will help students be successful. Everyone wants to hire the kindly behaving, cooperative worker, so the work world will no longer do harm to these characters. Contrariwise, they back up a stylish physique.

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) states that about one-third of U.S driving is obese. Here in the Causation Valley, that ailment connects to 46% of third-kennel students. Our private school is a 501(c)(3), so we inscribe to cater to all academically liable students in our region acreage, no point where they very physically. Welcome to the puzzle, but don't let the ""lack"" of private school athletic programmers or mammocks get you down. We have ways to remedy our half-pints to do away with being ""Hefty Hal's"" and ""Overweight Ollie's.""

If we would only ""do this small thing"", as Allan Expert put it, we may be fitted to cut ringworm, obesity, and humble behavior in and it of itself from our terminated. The comments are all broken and they are up to 8-fold when sports are added to the cancelation roster. When athletes are conscious that they must case at a certain even, they improve the grades in the classroom in the process. On the recap of everything else that has been put before you, case has been fixed so, what do we do, continue to abrade it or do we ""eat well and educate hard"" like Allan Expert composed. Well, I can't make that sentence for you, give to the give-and-take.",1
"The advantages of using limited car usage is that on cold nights and warm days the warmer layer or air trap car emissions. ""The smog rivaled Bejing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in he world. Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals. After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

United States has been one of the world's prime car cultures. Its the birthplace of the Model T;home of Detroit where Wilson Pickett immortalized ""Mustang Sally"". Has America passed peak driving? In source 4 it says in recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the  number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, acocording to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company.

Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. The next few years would be telling. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions,just behind power plants. Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves ""mobility"" companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vechicle. People who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. A car is just means of getting from A to B when BART doesnt' work.",0
