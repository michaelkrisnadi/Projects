Even though the computers could tell you how another person is feeling you could also do the same with your closest frineds and family because you kmow them so well. The computers have no idea who you are but they still know what emotion you are feeling just by how the bones in your face are working together.\n\nThe computer will form a 3-D model of the face. All of the 44 major muscles have to work exactly like the human muscles in the model. They have classified six basic emotions such as: happiness, surprise, disgust, anger, sadness, and fear. Most people like to hide their emotions with thier face so people don't know that something is wrong. The computer could see right through that and see exactly what emotion is going on.\n\nIn the classroom students that are shy or don't ask for help often lie to their teacher and tell them that they understand exactly whats goingon and exactly what they're doing. If we had those computers in the classrooms then the teachers could help us more by knowing the truth. The teachers could figure out a better way to teach the lesson so the kids are'nt so confused.\n\nThese computers could change lives but not many people probably see that since it's just another piece of technology. Imagine using this for someone yu are teaching or explaining something to yoou would want them to learn whatever that is you're helping them with would'nt you? But if that person is scared or shy they wouldn't be so easy to tell you that they don't understand. If we used these computers properly and not just as some toy then we could change how education is taught and it not being so difficult to understand so you could recieve better education quality.\n\nTeachers already try their best to help their students but sometimes it's just more difficult than it seems. Children like to give attitude when not understanding something or when they feel like the teacher is judging them because they don't understand something. When it comes to school and work it's alot of stress and focusing but if teachers had a better way to recognize the emotions of their students it'd be easier for them to help them out instead of leaving them there and not understand anything.\n\nI feel as if teachers would like the idea of having one of these computers in their classroom because not only does it benefit their students but it also benefits them by helping their generation out and not letting their students fail but to become successful. So I think that having these in the classroom would be very valuable and helpful for everyone."}]}

We have proof of this because our cameras are ten times sharper than the cameras we had to orginally photograph the face, the shadows just create an illusion that the formation is a face, and the Face on Mars has been confirmed to just be a mesa.\n\nThe first photo we had of the Face on Mars was taken in 1976 by Viking 1, which would not have had the most advanced cameras. The photo is blurry and unclear, not a very reliable source to base alien belief on. Even the photo in 1998, \"snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginal Viking phtos.\" Compare the photo from 1976 to the photo taken in 2001. The 2001 photo clearly shows that the Face on Mars is in fact not a face at all. Any belief that the Face on Mars was created by aliens should now be wiped away because of how clearly the photo shows that the Face is just a landform.\n\nWhen the original photos were taken in 1976, there was the illusion that there was a face staring right back at the Viking 1. Shadows around the Face created this illusion that made it look like and Egyptian Pharaoh. When the 1976 photo was released for people to see, the caption read, \"huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Even the experts immediately recognized the Face on Mars as just a natural landform with shadows.\n\nThough some people believed the Face was an alien artifact, this theory is disproved quickly because in truth the Face on Mars is just a mesa. The Face on Mars is in the area of Mars known as Cydonia. Cydonia is known for having lots of Martian mesas. Martian mesas are very similar to mesas or buttes found in the American West. Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program Jim Garving quotes, \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" Which is a lava dome the takes the form of an isolated mesa, and is approximately the same hight as the mesa known as the Face on Mars.\n\nThough some theorists still believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, it turns out to be just a Martian equivalent of a mesa. This is proved true by the advanced camera quality, the proof that it was just shadows creating the illusion that the Face on Mars was actually a face, and the fact that the Face has been confirmed to just be a mesa."}]}

No, the Electoral College is not worth keeping because it reflects the view of the electors instead of the people.\n\nSome people would argue that the Electoral college should be kept because it ensures the certainty of the outcome source 3 paragon 18. However this relies on a winner takes all system which makes the say of the minority voters pointless since even if they do vote then their vote is pointless. Second of all the presidents only campaign in states they are not sure of and completly ignore the states they know they will win source 3 paragraph 19. This may be a good strategy but if we instead abolished the Electoral College then everyones vote would matter and the candidate would have to campaign in every state to ensure his victory. In all the Electoral College should be abolished because it takes away say of the people.\n\nNot only does the Electoral college take away the say of the people, it also has no protection against a tie of states that have an even number of electors source 2 paragraph 11. For instance a state like hawaii that has a total of two electors if they both vote for different people then how are the votes decided well it already happened in 1960,but Richard Nixon who was the vice president at the time and known to be against the Electoral College decided to only aknowledge his opponents electors. That is why we should abolish the Electoral College.\n\nAllow me ask a hypothetical question what if the electors were corrupt and voted for whomever they pleased without even considering the peoples vote source 1 paragraph 2. We have no system to ensure that the people vote matters but the electors does therefore electors that are picked by former candidates may be more likely to return the favor and ignore the peoples vote and vote for their candidate. There are many important figures whom are against the Electoral College such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy carter, and Bob Dale there are many more but thes are all politicians who see the Electoral College the same way the people do source 2 paragraph.\n\nIn all the Electoral college should be abolished because it ignores the peoples votes.

Limiting our car usage isn't only a thing that the United States has to work on, but we see that Central America and Europe also has to work on it. Limiting our car usage isn't a small issue, but more of a global issue. Over the years we have seen the effects of global warming (something cause by fossil fuels, which is gas coming from our cars) and how they have had an enormous impact on our world. So, why is liming our car usage even remotely important to us?\n\nIn the second article \"Paris bans driving due to smog\", paragraph 10, the first thing it says is \"After days of near-record pollution..\", well, what does this say about how we're living today? Paris so close to to being on record breaking pollution, not that it's anything to be proud of. But, if that's how much pollution Paris has, which is a famous city for not only being the \"City of Love\", but for also being big, how will every other city's pollution be? Cities have been growing and expanding so much recently, factories are being built and more cars are being sold, how will this help limiting our car usage? If cities keep expanding, we'll just be adding to the pollution that already exists. After a couple decades all the issues we seem to be ignoring will come up and if the problems are bad now, how bad will they be in the future? This isn't just something we can ignore!\n\nLike David Goldberg says in paragraph seven in \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" \"All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car..\". Why have we been focusing more on a car than on health and medicine and cures for some illnesses? Why is a car so important? Yes it makes going to places much more easier and quicker, but at what cost will we go to to make things easier on us? It isn't jsut about the pollution caused from our cr usage, but it's also about our health. There are fewer and fewer parks by the year because we'd rather have all our tax money go towards roads instead parks. More malls are opening up and more fast food places are opening up on big interstates and highways, and now all we really have to being close to nature is when we pass by the trees near the interstates and highways. We need trees in order to have oxygen, but if all this pollution is slowly killing trees, how much more time do we have left before we realize it's too late to try saving our trees and limiting our car usage? Back then no one really worried much about limiting our car usage and pollution, because it wasn't that bad. Now all you ever really hear is about pollution and how to stop it.\n\nEven though we really have got to start limiting our car usage, there is still hope in lowering and or even stopping pollution. We could start off small, for instance, by having a day where no one is allowed to drive their cars to places or be fined if you do drive, like Bogota, Colombia does in \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\". It must've had a positive effect because it encouraged Cali and Valledupar, two other Colombian cities, to participate in the event as well."}]}

Automobiles have alwayas been extremly useful and necesary to our society, however, it had too, some significant disadvantages that could have great impact on our lives. Having this clear now we can point ouit tghe advantages of limiting the car usage no matter how hard or difficult it might be to the biggest cities or more developed societies.\n\nIt is important to notice an experiment that was conducted in Germany, the city of Vauban was finished in 2006 and it is an example of a \"car-free\" environment with a few exceptions such as the main street and borders, acording to Elizabeth Rosenthal in her article: \"In German Suburbs, Life Goes On Without Cars\". In the passage it is explained how people gave up a certain lifesctyle to participate in this new progect and it proves how limiting the usage of car can create a very succesful and less stresful future. 70% of the population of this city do not own cars, one of them, Heidrum Walter said: \"When I had a car I was aleays tense, I'm much happier this way,\" proving again how advantagous is this experiment.\n\nIn the other had, there is France's capital; Paris, which banned driving due to smog. \"Diesel fuel was blamed\" expressed Robert Duffer on his atricle, additionally refering to its use which makes up 67% of the vehicles in France. As a resulf of the fines and free public transpartation on business days the smog cleared enough so part of the ban was rescinded. Another example of the advantages of reducing car usage is how \"its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution\" added Carlos A. Plaza, a colombian participating in the car-free day that takes place in Bogota every year. This event motivates people not just in the Colombian capital to ride bikes and be healthier but everyone around them, including adjacent southamerican countries. For instance, stadistics talk too, and it is possible that America getting over its obsession with cars, which is amazing news due to the fact that mobiles vehicles represent the second largest source of carbon emissions in America, as discused on \"The End of Car Culture\" by Elizabeth Rosenthal.\n\nAll in all, limiting car usage - although a difficul decision for most residents of develeped first-worls countries - might just be one of the greatest steps we could take towards helping our envirionment and forging a new society, shaping it a better way, building healthier kids that will excersice and ejoy more the outsides, and that will breathe cleaner, fresher air. We can improve our atmosphere's condition refereing to greenhouse gasses and carbon emissions and in addition, lead out economy a different direction, maybe to a better, improved world and society that does not depend on mechanic vehicles."}]}

The reason Humens should explore the Unknown Venus is becuase it was the closest planet to Earth terms of density and size. Venus is dangers for a humen to explore but not an unman spacecraft to go near the surface. Venus is tricky and challanging to explore becuase of the high temeratures that average 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the Atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Even though Mercury is the closet to our sun.\n\nOn the depths of the surface of Venus there is alot going on, as in erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightign strikes. Scientists are already discussing how to visit the Venus surface which means they also want to explore and study Venus. Venus once have been like Earth-like planet in our solar system. It has some land features if rocky sediment, Valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus is sometimes our nearest option for a planetary visit, given the long time frames of space travel. The Value of returning to venus seems unlikly.\n\nNASA is creating a blimp-like vehicle to hover 30 or more miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. The almost easy task for the vehicle would use solar power becuase the sun would be above it all the time. Even in high altitude the climate is still pretty hot that is around 170 degree Fahrenheit. The downfall to being so high up above 30 or more miles is not much research will go on becuase the limited view we well get. More importantly is that scientist can't get samples of rocks, gases, and anything else since the spacecraft will be high up.\n\nScientist is now looking at old technology called mechanical computers. The \"old Technology\" uses gear and levers but not electronics at all. Modern computers are more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions. mechanical parts are more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces then a computer. What I think is that Venus is worth the pursuit despite the danger it can bring. Venus does have value to be explored because who doesn't love a challenge? I sure do love a challenge."}]}

But would it be valuable in a classroom of students.\n\nIn my personal opinion i say yes it would be valuable. I think it would not only be valuable to students but also to teachers. It would be helpfull to students because say for example you have a crush on a fellow classmate but dosent know how she feels about you with a app called snapchat you are able to communicate through pictures, so if you knew how she felt about the conversation based on the selfie she sent it would give you a accurate idea of how she feels about you.

But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the\u00a0 number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, acocording to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company.\n\nPart of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. The next few years would be telling. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions,just behind power plants. Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves \"mobility\" companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vechicle. People who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. A car is just means of getting from A to B when BART doesnt' work."}]}
