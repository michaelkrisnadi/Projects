"Venus is the planet of our solar system. Occasionally Venus is the closest planet to Earth in term of size as well as distance. Venus, also known as ""Evening Star,"" is a second planet from our sun that makes it more brighter and warmer. Venus is covered with a large blanket of carbon dioxide. The temperature on the Venus is approximately 800 degrees Fahrenhite, and also has the atmospheric pressure 90 time greater than on Earth, this circumstances make the Human life quite impposible on Venus. Venusian geology has impediments like volcano eruption and earthquickes.

Do you ever feel how interesting it would be to visit places that are out of this world? Or, do you ever thought, what if we get the chance to visit different planets like Venus or Mars? Well, we are no longer away from the time when we will visit different planets for our vacation trips. Although our neighboring planets are inhospitable of human life, however ; Astronomers are fascinated about Venus because it may once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago Vinus was covered with oceans and could have supported various froms of life. Even today, Venus have some features that are analogous to those on the Earth. Human's have sent plethora number of spacecrafts to Venus but didn't get success. NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to the study Venus. NASA's possible solution to hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray, as the temperature would be around 170 degrees Farhrenheit above that land, it will make easier for humans to research on Venus. To get samples of rock or gas, scientists has to conduct a mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and persional despite the risks. NASA has discovered that electronic devices made of silicon carbide can last for three weeks on Venus as they will not melt easily. NASA and many other organizations are working hard to make it possible for human to visit other planets.

As we know, how many different condition are becoming hindurance for humans to visit Venus, but we are no longer away from the time when human will visit other planets and will research about that planet. Recently scientists has discovered that their is a life possible on Mars. Many organizations like NASA and Space-X are working hard to send humans to Mars. Similarly we will find the way to land on Venus and know more about it. Our travels beyond the Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination.",0
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author said studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because of the climate. This is true because if we, humans, decide to go well will be more likely to die than going to mars. Venus is the closest planet in shape and size to Earth, although the Earth and Venus are close to being twins Venus can be a challenge to get close to because of the climate.

On Venus the atmosphere is pretty thick. Almost 97% carbon dioxide and the temperture is 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Don't forget that it is 90 times more that we have experenced here on Earth. This environment wouild destroy a submarine and turn it in to liquid. Although almost exacly the side of the Earth, Venus has the hottest surface in our solar system.

There is stories that say there use to be large oceans on Venus that covered half of the surface where it could support life like Earth. NASA is coming up with solutions to study the planet without sending humans. The built a vehicle that hovers 30 miles or so above the roiling Venusian landscape. Reseachers cannot take samples of rocks gas or anything else that far away. This is why it could be a risk for humans, we need to be up close to study the planet but if we do de might die from the heat.

This is some of the reasons why in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author said studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.",0
"I have never liked Government intervention on desicions that should be left up to the people who feel the effect of mandate. However, Government intervention on limiting the amount of car usage may prove to be a genuinely good cause. It may prove to accomplish what Government was first formed to do; help shape the world to make it a better place to co-exist, not only with each other, but with the whole Earth.

At fist, it may seem a little crazy in our day and age to actually reverse the climb of our use of technology and innovation, like vehicles. After all, isn't that what we're supposed to do? Isn't it natural to constantly evolve as time passes? Well, cars aren't natural, and they destroy what is.

We are facing dangerous pollution; ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" (Source 2, 10). This is alarming to me and many people who care for the Earth. Every day, we're facing new headlines of negativity, and although whether Kim Kardashian's dress fits or not is upsetting, I think we need to focus on more important things and expell the negativity we're always bashed with. We could be developing things that will really make an impact, like new breakthrough sciences on space, medical sciences, and so much more. Instead, ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"" (Source 1, 7).

But, there is hope in all this. Already, we're seeing improvements. ""The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company"" (Source 4, 32). Maybe reversing the climb of our use of cars isn't so hard after all; we can hit the ground running.

A reduction in the ownership of cars has also shown a surprising improvement of psychological well-being. In Vauban, Germany, they have almost completely cut out automobile use in their community. ""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor"" (Source 1, 3). It sounds like people can be much happier without the constant buzz of cars coming and going. The mention of children also makes me think that it would be a much safer environment to raise children without the stress of parents having to worry if their children would be safe with so many cars about. I think everyone remembers their parents telling them time and time again to look both ways before crossing, and then double check, and then hold their hand, and watch out for right-turning traffic. A reduction in automobile use, in this case, is directly related to the stress parents have over their children when doing something so simple as crossing the street.

In addition, a reduction in automobile use and ownership gives the local Government something more beneficial to focus on, rather than spending millions on re-paving roads; ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" (Source 3, 28). With this change, local Government can focus on really improving the standard of living; more job openings with more buisinesses, easier travel (despite what one might think) during rush-hour, and a higher level of general safety with less danger of car accidents.

All in all, I think it will be a hard transition to go through if Government does plan to get involved in the reduction of car usage. It's easy to make bad habits, but it's hard to break them. However, if we do succeed, we will see a huge improvement on the environment and the standard of living, and it will be really worth it. These are not views or opinions; these are facts.",0
"Have you ever thought that there are aliens in space?

Many people believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. The Face on Mars was not created by aliens due to it's common landform shade.

Mars Global Surveyor was used to take pictures of Mars. The picture showed the Face was the equivalent to the size of a butte or mesa. Butte or mesas are common landforms around the American West. A famous one is the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Martain mesas are very common around Cydonia. Cydonia is a region of Mars. It is not uncommon for a rock formation to resemble something like a face. The shadows on Cydonia gave the illusion of eyes, nose and a mouth on the natural rock formation.

People who support that the Face was created by aliens believe that there is life on Mars and that NASA is hiding this information. This is not true. NASA wishes that there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Life on Mars would be great business for NASA and they would have no reason to hide it from the public.

The first picture of the Face was taken in 1976. Eighteen years later, Mars Global Surveyor landed on the Red Planet. The technonlogy was way more advanced now. The NASA scientists were able to get a picture ten times sharper that the orginal Viking photo. This proved to the thousands of waiting web sufers that the Face was a natural landform.

The Face is a natural landform. Scientists at NASA have spent years finding evidence to prove that the Face is a natural landform. As of 2001, the Face was proven to be a natural landform and that there are no aliens on Mars.",0
"The using of cars has caused much of the worlds green house gas imitions, in America as much as 50% of the imitions are caused souly by transportation. Many people feel that this is destroying our atmosphere and that we should cut down on imitions by walking, biking or car pooling. Efforts to cut down keep our atmosphere clean and breathable. Some communities such as Vauban, Germany have illiminated car use entirely.

Vauban is a new experimental suburb where there is no street parking or driveways and the only place to park is in a garage where you must buy a space for 40,000 which has cut the car ownership rate down to only about 30%. There are as many as 5,500 residents in Vauban and most of them say they like it much better without having to worry about a car. In many suburbs however the houses are much to far apart for them to be car-free, though many areas are considering developments like this one so they can clean up the air.

Other cities, such as Paris, are fourced to ban driving for days at a time in order to clear the thick smog that hovers above the city. On one day odd numbered plates won't be allowed to drive and on the next day even, volaters are fined $31. As many as 4,000 drivers are fined. Only once the smog was sufficently cleared did they allow both plate types to drive. Limiting driving can prevent problems like this from occuring in all cities.

In Colombia they have a day where all cars are banned, chalanging the inhabitance to find alternate routs of travel for fear of the $25 fine for violators. The day without cars began in the mid-1990's for Bogota, a city with a population of 7 million, has participated, but last year two other cities in Colombia joined in. Dispite the rainy weather many people still hiked or rode their bikes. Many citizens say that it keeps the cities air clear and that its nice to have a day without traffic jams filling the streets. The Day without cars is an event that many countries hope to adopt.

Studies show that many people from the newest generation aren't bothering to get a licence. Cell phones and apps make car pooling easy and the internet allows you to interact with friends without having to drive to visit them. Experts are hoping this trend will continue and that it will cut down the gas imitions. With increased use of social networking technology hopefully people will also become more aware of how they are affecting their planet and move to help others cut down as well.",0
"Everyone remembers mars the planet that Nasa was trying to get on to see if it's possible to live on? Well now they changed into a diffrent planet called Venus.

The author of the article ""The challenge of exploring Venus"" is stating his choice on what Nasa is doing. He is making it very clear that he wants people to explore Venus. He gave a hint in one part of his story. For example he says ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has valuse, not only becuase og insite to be gained on the planet its self."" He's is giving his full suport on Nasa's choice to go and study Venus. He also is saying to keep trying even though it is dangerous. In the text it says that ""A thick atmoshpere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" This Is saying that its very dangerousover there on Venus and the pressure could destroy everything there.

In Conclusion he gives his full support no matter what. He is hoping that they keep striving to find a way to successsfuly accomplish whatever they need to do.",0
"Phones & Driving

Using cell phones while driving has a big impact on car wrecks, I believe that cell phone usage while operating a motor vehicle should be prohibited because they play a big part in distracting the driver.

One reason cell phone usage should be prohibited is because when one is looking in their cell phone they usually look down and look back up but anything could happen in a split second leading to an immediate reaction without thought. According to studies and statistics ""Almost 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving"". Meaning out of all of the accidents that happen yearly 390,000 are due to texting and driving which could easily be prevented, just wait to send that text.

Another reason cell phone usage should be prohibited is because it takes up time, the time you're using to send that one text or make that one call could be time used to get where you're going. The use of a cell phone while driving is inconsiderate of other drivers, it takes up their time as well. When people use their cell phones they only think of themselves, imagine if the driver behind you were in danger and you're using your phone wasting time at the green light. Most people don't put themselves in other people's places, yet things that you do can have an effect on another's personal life. If this was you in danger would you want someone driving slow in front of you because of their cell phones that they could check when they arrive to where they are going?.

Next, cell phones could cause anybody to do reckless driving. You could be on any social media and try to see what's going on in everybody else life instead of your own. Social media could wait on you until you get home. Cell phones cause reckless driving which cause accidents that could be prevented only if you waited those seconds. You never know what someone might say about you on social media, and you could get caught up in the drama. Driving while mad isn't a good mix. You could take your anger out while driving extremely fast then boom you crash.

Furthermore, you're not paying attention to your driving, and road signs. Besides the green light there are more road signs. Like what if you were on your phone and you don't see the sign that signals a deaf child is alert. Then a deaf child was crossing the street, and you crash into them. This could be murder, and soon you'll be there locked up rotting in jail. Somethings are meant to be considered before you pick up your phone and text while driving. Most accidents could be avoided if you wouldn't be so careless about others. In a passage it stated ""Cell phones aren't the reason why there are car accidents."" This isn't accurate because based on my research at least 88% of people die from car accidents.

In conclusion cell phones should be prohibited while driving. Most accidents can be caused by using a cell phone while driving. Think about a consequence that could come with your actions while using your cell phone, neither the less it can wait. There could be an occurring accident that could be prevented all if you would be careful and mindful of people. You should consider putting your phone on airplane mode while driving. It will make driving more easier and safer for you and the people you are surrounded by.",0
"Since World War II, driving has been the center of everyone's mind. Do you really think driving is a necessity? Many people will say yes, but most will argue no. Limiting car usage will be great for us citizens and our very own planet Earth.

To start off, driving causes you a stressful day, but not driving will save you time and money. Gas prices are more than 2 a gallon. One car takes more or less 10 gallons. Filling your tank up will cost you around 60 or more. In my eyes, it's cheaper to take public transportation than to drive. While taking the bus or the train , all you really have to do is wait , pay to get in, find your stop, if your destination is a little farther, there can be another bus and you'll be at your stop. On the other hand, Driving, your worrying more. Your worried about if you have gas, is there a traffic jam, why is this driver driving so slow. You're getting frustrated rather than taking the public transportation. In Colombia there is this program where you dont drive for a day. ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams""Source 3. Not only did it cause a less stressful day, it allowed them to get some exercise.

Furthermore, I have a question. How many people like smoggy days? No one. Reason I asked this specific question is mainly because if you enjoy driving, you must enjoy the smog. ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city""Source 2. Although Paris has more smog than other European capitals, it isnt good for our very own health, but it isnt good for our planet either. When Paris did this ""No Driving"" campigan, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after 5 days of intensifying smog""Source 2.

On the other hand, driving isn't really important as it used to be. We have all these technological advances, that honestly make driving not necessary. We all have a cell phone, we can all video chat. Some work together, some go to school together. We all can carpool. There was this quote that I read, and after doing some thinking, it made me realize that driving isn't really important as it seemed to be. ""How much you drive is as important as whether you have an hybrid""Source 1. Hybrids save alot of wrong doings that we already do to this Earth. Along with eletronic cars. Driving a hybrid, yes it's saving the world but your still causing traffic, and wasting money. Some people have already quit driving. ""With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit."" Source 4. America has went so far into the stopping of driving that on highways there's more tolls. Tolls that we can't pay to another person, tolls where they take a picture of your license, find out you information, and send you the amount you owe through the mail. Each toll is different some can be 75 cents or a 1.50. From your home to the mall, depending where you live, you'll pass by more a less 5 tolls. In total thats around I'll say 3.75 or 7.50. Public transportation saves you more money. Mall's have buses where it picks you up from a specfic location to the mall and back. That's saving you time and your money.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can be an advantage to both young, old and even to our very own planet Earth. It can help our economy, save our pollution rate, but also help us lose the weight.",0
"In a big city or a rual area all you see are cars flying past you at high speeds and releasing their gas fumes into the atmosphere. Having no cars is a great solution to having no traffic and less polution. Without cars our air would be fresh and it wouldnt take as long to get from place to place.

Although many people have cars and drive them regularly it is not always the best choice. Having no cars would be a drastic change to society but it would also be a major change in the way we travel and breathe in air. In Vauban, Germany the residents have gave up on cars. The streets are car free. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there"". This piece from the text tells us that hardly any one is driving a car their. One of the residents says ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way"" this lets us no that without a car the resident is much happier and is not tense. Car release greenhouse gas emissions from there tailpipes. In the article ""In German suburb, life goes on without cars"" it says that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"". That is insane to think that much is released, but its happening daily from everyday car users. The environmental agency is trying to promote car reduced communities. Polution got so bad in Paris that they had to enforce a partial driving ban. After enforcing this the texts says "" congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog"". So limiting their drving in Paris reduced the smog. It is not always the best choiceto drive all the time exspecially if you job or social event your going to isn't far. In ""The end of car culture"" it says "" organize your summer jobs and social life around where you can walk or take public  transportation or car-pool"". By doin those things it will reduced smog and gases getting into the air.

By not having any cars it would reduce polution, give us safer air to breathe, and it would be easier to get from place to place with any traffic. Cars release tons of gases and polute the air. WIthout cars it would reduce that problem. With less cars on the road and mostly public transportation it would be easy to get around instead of getting caught up in traffic. So not having cars wouldn't be such a bad thing after all.",0
"These four passages ""In german suburb , life goes on without cars "" , ""Paris bans driving due to smog , "" Car -free day is spinning into a hit hit in bogota  and "" The end of car culture . Talk about life with out cars , how that benefits us and how it makes people feel.

Source one talks about life in Vauban , germany and how cars arent allowed in the suburbs . If so then you need to pay a fee . Not using cars is better for the environment and makes people feel better about themselfs . ""When i had a car i was always tense . Im much happier this way "" stated heidrun walter . You see more people outside , riding boikes , and children playing . 70 percent of people in vauban dont own cars , and 57 percent of people sold their cars so they could live there . Also in source two it talks about the banning of cars in order to clear the air of the global city . Anyone who refused to stop using their cars were fined . Paris had more smog than other european capitals . In source three People of the city bogota , colmbia , hd a free day also in order to get rid of smog . People hiked , took buses , or skated places .""its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution ."" Stated businessman carlos arturo . Improvements have also been made to the city . such as new side walks ,less traffic,parks , and sports centers .People are way happier . In source four it talks about how americans are becoming less interested in cars . Sociologists believe that it will have a positive impact on carbon emissions . Limiting car usage is better for the environment and the people who live in it . Its better for people to ride bikes and go walking . I think that if everyone would continue to stop driving then the world would be a better place .People would live longer , less violence and more happiness .

In conclusion , driving cars can cause a big probem in people lives . things would be easier if everyone quit driving all together .More and more people each year dont get their licence or just stop driving period . Thats how things should be .",0
