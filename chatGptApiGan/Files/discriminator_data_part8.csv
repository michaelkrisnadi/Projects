"People should not have cars, is becuse it analysis a lot of problems wen use it, people have a lot of reason by usnig it, and people dresser can be diffrid just by tips diey have with them using a car.

Firstly, one of the resons why we should not use car is becuse it analysis a lot of problems when wasing it, like out us or space snd the most important things that not only we have when we uses the car but also when we use the bus, the car has anon advantage. For example, if on a car crash one of the passenger get a problme it is very hard to find the solution to cure him, and it is more dangrous to use the car because of air pollution, noise pollution and water pollution.

Secondly, one of the reasons with that people are familiar is a lot by usin the car that we change our transportation, is very harms would days because they not longer saw ther friends becuse they did not how they was go to ther house but the population whit that is going down now using something that a lot of people does is very important. For example, in paris most of the people were usinhare cars but ther job is very stressed because of cars so the major of then decided to use car ten to take the stress off beacus now they can talk with thier childrens and they say that the love it and the buses hae Less delay when the used it theis why the major of them vote for th enew life using more the bu.

Finaly, one very important reason to undersad why we should not have car is becuse by not using it we can have less stress and less problems such As traffic jam, aacrash and more. For example, That always was one of the probems that we have every day to many people because very stressed by traphic jam theh were very mean but when many people that have blog were see the first person to have the day on sunday of a lot of people less stressed by not having traffic jam the car-freeouthday so they were ver happy so they cant relax more. But other of the bennnefir so they can also think that does not using the car is not a bain but it is a god bennefit for us.

In conclusion, people or the most of the people dont know why is that researchers dont want that we have a car but i explai you with spefic examples that we should not have care its not a only a limitation we have but is a god think for us. So now undersaint the opposed side and follow the new life vithou care but with other life having a good day and ignoring the problems by not using the car that is a car many people mor ehappy days by diey.

"Many Americans today use cars to commute from one place to another, like work or going to school. However, in recent times, car usage has significantly decreased due to its beneficial effect on many communities. Based on the information given, there are many advantages of limiting car usage.

One of many advantages of limiting the usage of cars is that it can help the community. With lower car usage, the community's environment can potientally become much better. According to Source 2, France's partial driving ban caused its congestion to go ""down 60 percent... after five-days of intensifying smog."" This drastic change in France's car traffic prevented further pollution and smog, which hurts the community. Addtionally, limiting car usage can push more people into excercising more. In Bogota, Colombia, many Colombians ""hiked, biked, skated..."" during their car-free days (source 3). Also, many ""parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city"" (source 3). With an increase of excercise, the community's people will not only become healthier and fitter, but prevent any more damage to the community.

Futhermore, lowering car uage will benefit the community's patrons by providing a cleaner lifestyle. With limiting their car usage, the people of the community will save more money. According to Source 1, although cars aren't recommended, a car-owner may ""buy a space, for $40,000, along with a home (source 1)."" Normally, a decent size house is approximately $100,000 to $ 150,000 with parking as well. To add onto this, gas prices can become very expensive, especially to those to drive a lot. All this money spent on a pollution causing car can be put towards a child's education, or the community's benefit. Plus, the stress of ensuring a car's wellbeing at all times is eliminated as well, decreasing the amount of stress in citizens. Addionally, people are more happy with limited usage of cars. People like Heidrun Walter have said ""I'm much happier this way (source 1),"" because they feel safer and can provide more to the community. Happier people in the community leads a much cleaner, stress-free lifestyle where its inhabitants are able to thrive more.

The advantages of limiting car usage includes assisting the community and providing a cleaner lifestyle for its patrons. With a positive community, the future generation's lifes will be enhanced. The youth of a community with a great outlook on the world will provide futher citizens with another fantasic community with the potential to grow and change. However, without this, the community will not thrive nor grow.",0
"The computer has great influence on our lives. It has its advantages and its disadvantages. Many things are done on the computer like typing a letter instead of hand writing it. Some people can only go to work if they have their laptop to do things that are needed for work. They do not need paper or to use gas for the car because everything they need is on the laptop. We have some people who are always on social media. They do a lot of scrolling. Some people have to post things about their lives everyday so that others can see. Some people take the internet serious, like if they purchase something and it is not what they wanted they will go in a mad rage, but dont think about returning it by mailing the product, they will destroy the product by running it over in their car a hundred times or shooting it the next day, they will even go to the exstreame by thre...",1
"Car-Free Cities

Humans almost feel the need to own a car almost as much as they feel the need to own a phone.  The automobile industry has been a growing industry since World War 2.  There are so many advantages to limiting car usage.  Saving on gas and getting good exercise are just a few of the great advantages of limiting car usage.

Vauban, Germany understands that according to Source 1 which talks about how they have given up their cars!  Not only is it saving them a ton of money on gas, car insurance, car payments, and fixing parts, it also gives them all great exercise.  If everyone walks everywhere everyday the whole city will be fit in no time.  Another advantage to the loss of cars, no car accidents.  180,000 people die a year due to car accidents.  The death's in this city will be reduced drastically due to no cars.  This no car movement is a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere as a component of a movement called ""smart planning"".

Source 2 talks about how Paris has banned driving due to smog.  Congestion went down 60 percent in the capital of France.  Delivery companies in Paris complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers.  The advantages of limiting car usage here is the you'd never have to worry about there being smog outside or snow etc.  Limiting car usage, you wouldn't have to worry about the weather being so terrible that you can't drive in smog or heavy rain and have a car accident.

Bogota, Colombia joins the no car movement for what is known as ""Car-Free Day"".  Source 3 discusses the day without cars in Bogota, Colombia.  It is an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s.  It's seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to their city's mayor.  Limiting car usage in this city could be great for a lot of reasons.  One being they are the only Latin-American city to have covered 118 miles of bicycle paths.  Their parks and sports centers are now blooming throughout the city.  It's uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks.

Source 4 talks about the End of Car Culture.  Studies have shown that as the years go on, driving is becoming less and less popular which is sad for many automobile industries worldwide.  In America, the partial cause of the decrease in car usage is the unemployment rate being so low, it's not like someone has to go to work.  Gas is becoming to expensive, why would people even want to have cars if they can barely afford them?  Riding a bicycle is beneficial for more money in your pocket and more healthiness for your body.",0
"Landon is excited to start driving to school, except he can't. In fact, he is the one who changed where he lived because of the Driving law. Not being able to Drive is a great idea and should be enforced for all countries.

Even though many Americans would say that Not being able to drive is a bad idea. There are many positives to it. In fact There has been a ""62% Drop in Confucions and 54% decline in crashes."" Since 2009 Newark, New Jersey has had the toughest driving-laews in the US. Fact is car crashes injure or kill more than 1milion people each year. 5 People in Germany challened the Driving laws as part of a polocies class. Most of them liked not driving. Urban planners have already started to design areas of northern europe for more home and job accessibility to reduce driving.

Another reason we should not have driving is the expensive costs. In  2013 the American Association of state college and universities relesed that more than have of first time car buyers in college said they would Consider ouf a car if smartphone appre continued to upgrade the public transportation system. Carlenders stretch up to 7 years, But some don't give you a car if you owe tax money.

The most comman reason people say we should have driving is because of freedom, but that is wrong. All around the US people are starting to not like driving as much. 30% of 16 year-olds did not get there license in 2008, In 2010 it was 48%. Many baby-boomers are retiring and then selling their cars. More and more people are starting to see that the should not drive, but if all the cars from the government-driving is gone from the driving is that.The is a new movement in the US that started in 2007 called the ""Green Driving"". This means very little car use. More and more we see that driving is being proved that they should not. Like all the people in Europe that got fined for braking ""car use"" taxes.

In Conclusion we should nnot drive. There are so many reasons that driving should go away, but the is something we can do about it.",1
"In the United States, car wrecks because of distracted drive are increasing. The leading reason to distracted driving is cell phones. While most people appear to be aware of the dangers of using the cellphone while driving, they even continue to take this risk. What would it take to make people to quit utilizing their cell phones while operating their car?

Cell phones have become a part of many people's daily lives, making it a struggle for them to sit the down long enough to drive and reach their destination. In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were calculated to have cellphones in hand while behind the wheel. Cellphone usage while traveling has become the number one cause for vehicle accidents over the last two decades.

Using the phone while driving increases not only the driver, but the people around them chances of getting into an accident. In addition to it lessens the driver's awareness of their surroundings while on the road, causing more car accidents. ""Auto deaths have risen for two straight years, marking the biggest increase in more than dive decades. While lower gas prices have encouraged more driving, distracted driving due to cellphones has been tapped as one of the major causes. That has prompted many states to begin cracking down on phone use while driving with laws outlawing the behavior."" (Pressman, A..Apr.2017)

An increasing amount of states, prohibit the usage of cell phones while behind the wheel, exposing those drivers who break the laws to fines and additional punishments. What many drivers don't realize is that, not only could they receive fines for using their phone, but they could also be served with serious lawsuits if they cause an accident.

A large number of drivers do not believe that their driving performance is impacted by the usage of their cellphones. More than one half of drivers who speak on cell phones while driving feel as if their driving is no different from them being off the phone. This shows that many people are ignorant to the impact they have on their selves and others when they use their phones while driving. This also shows why it's so important to have such strict rules and laws. ""Road safety appears to improve in states with laws that regulate driver's phone use. The states with the lowest amount of phone use while driving- Vermont, Oregon, Hawaii, and Washington- have all banned the use of handheld devices behind the wheel.""(Johnson, D.Apr.2018)

To sum it up, the use of phones while driving has proven to be a huge safety hazard to drivers and those surrounding them. There should be laws in all states and even countries that ban the use of any device or distraction while driving in order to decrease the number of accidents on the road. It would also help people to practice using their phones less and become not so dependent on their phones.",0
"Intellectual freedom is a basic human right. Everyone should be able to have their own thoughts and opinions without being critized. Additionally, every individual should be able choose their own oppinions and beliefs. Intellectual freedom allows for a more accepting and open minded society.

People should be able to have their own thoughts without being critized. In the ad, the young girl is judged for the type of computer she uses although no statement about her says she is American. The statement that is just because she uses a different kind of computer she is american is a prime example of critisism. Beside the fact that the ad completely contradicts the picture, crossing out the United States of American and replacing it with the technology capital of South America justs shows how we are falling into a society that relies on technology. Also, no individual should be labeled because of the equipment they use.

In addition, everyone should be able to choose their own thoughts and beliefs. In the ""Lividity of Demonstrators"" article, a reasoning as to why the Syrian revolution failed is given. The reason stated why the rebellion started in Syria is because the Middle East is ""a deeply religious and sectarian restricts who's Sunni majority has long stewed beneath the heavy hand of the Alawai elite. The Syrians were greatly affected by their laws and rules and finally rose up against them in the revolt. The Syrians were denied intellectual freedom. They were not even aloud to have certain beliefs, read a wide variety of literature, or have access to the world through the internet. The revolt could have been potentially avoided if the Sydney government was more accepting.

Lastly, intellectual freedom is important because it leads to a more accepting and open minded society. When everyone has their own thoughts and beliefs, there is a wider variety of ideas that can be shared. This allows people to think differently and not be stuck in one way of thinking. In the ad, when the girl posts a picture of her new shirt, all of her ""friends"" say something negative. They all critize her for wearing anything besides what they consider to be socially acceptable. However, when the boy sees the picture of her he starts flirting with her by saying she has good ""stylefogell."" Because the boy was comfortable enough to give her a compliment instead of critizing her, they live in a very open society. This allows people to find new oppinions and beliefs and it averts critisim.

In conclusion, intellectual freedom is important for a variety of reasons. Including that every individual should not be critized for their beliefs and thoughts and they should be able to choose their own. Additionally, intellectual freedom is significant because it leads to a more open minded and accepting society.",1
"Studying Venus, Huh? I agree, but it'll be too dangerous and very risky. But before that lets learn about Venus and whats its about. Tune in to find out!

In the article it states, ""Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the brightest planets in the night sky, making it simple to catch in the night. In our solar system, Venus is right next to our sun. Venus is ovbisouly simple to see, but very hard to study it. Venus is called the Earth's twin, becuase of their size and density, density meaning how big and large it is. Venus goes at different speeds then the other planets.""

Now that you know somethings about Venus according to my sources, lets get into it if you should study it or not. Personally based on what I read, I would agree to study it up close. But, it'll be very dangerous. NASA is going to have to do a lot of work to get job done. It's not going to be easy, you can't just go up there and expect to study a large, massive planet. A lot of stuff goes into doing these type of things. Venus according to the article, ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Beyond high pressure and heat."" So, you can't just go up there with just any type of vehicle, spaceship, etc your going to have to do some serious moding... just an insane type of transpotportation to go up there.

In the article it sates, ""NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus."" They've tested some models an they actually worked. They just need to do little to a lot more work and the job will be done. To me, I feel like NASA can do it, I mean what can't they do. They think the impossible and create the impossible. Whoever are the people going up there... make it happen!

Therefore, I know it's a tough task, but I know they can do it. I mean, like I said, what can't NASA do. They think the impossible then do the impossible.",0
"In 1912 air driven car was spawn in the mind of a french inventor named Guy Nègre and was created with the help of his former aviation buddy Louis Germion. These cars are govered by using compreessed air pressure in one or more tanks they can go up to 8000 miles between refuels with their 120 mile max speed that can accelrate to 60 in 4.5 seconds. Air folded cars are fuel efficent with over 100 mpgs and they do not polute the air. These cars are faster than most cars on the road capable of going an excessive of 70 mph.

After 2-4 minutes of refueling the car can last 93-125 miles equivalent of 150-200 km depending on your driving style. On the positive side: it only costs $254 a year to drive with the amount of refueling and that there is no emmision of carmo dioxide or carbon monoxide. On the negative side: There are few refuels stations and the vechicle's cost $0-700 and the amount repairing is $100-200.

Specifically in Paris, France the air cars were approved for the taxis and their hiring companies . Hollande approved the decree to add 1000 air gast tazis to the roads of France. Italy has started the building of the factory to be completed in 2018 to build all makes of airdriven cars providing 200 assembly line jobs. On the negative side Italy fined Aircar for unproven business of selling permits to produce air cars and allowing Air france to use their name.

Incredible the human need of cars has come to an end. Because there is a new innovative car powered by compressed air that prevents the pollution that is formed by cars. They are fast, strong, and what is best thats the are more safe for the human population. The wealth of Pharmindustrail however, sees and dislikes this new resource since it is causing the drop down sales of cars but they do not realize that they will earn more for their drugs and other products which are vfeicled to keep growing once there is more technology to make new things that will cause the cycle to start again. Meanwhile drugs have a steadfast depend on technology since the government mandates to change systems to have big pahramicuitcial pay their medications. And technology is also ideally for cars which shades the mecancian and fast and furious users of cars to change that fact and to value the use of other devices.",1
"In cities such as Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, people are getting serious about cutting down on the vast usage of cars. The ""car free"" trend is beginning to spread throughout the world, and even to places in America. By limiting car usage, the state of the environment improves, a more healthy lifestyle is promoted, and opportunities for other innovations are brought into the light.

In Paris, a driving ban was enforced to help clear the air of polluants. This ban lowered the congestion by 60 percent, and according to reporter Robert Duffer, ""The smog rivaled Bejing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gasses in Europe, and up to 50 percent in areas where cars are used more often, such as the United States. The Environmental Protecion Agency is promoting car reduced communities in America, where even legislators are beginning to act. By elimitating cars from the everyday equation, one also eliminates the greenhouse gasses and other pollutants, which makes the planet a healthier place to live.

With less and less cars being utilized, there are more opportunites for people to get active by biking, walking, and participating in other active means of getting from point A to point B. According to news reportes Andrew Selsky and Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""The swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occassional distant moter"", and ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks."" Without cars, citizens are encouraged to get active. Condensed cities allow people to walk to their destination, which drastically improves an individual's heart health, along with aerobic activity such as biking.

An official from Transportation for America says, ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."" Sociologists believe that America has passed peak driving, and cars are no longer the focus of improvement. The Internet makes telecommuting possible, which is much more convenient than using automobiles because people can feel connected without the drive. This and the rise in cellphones implies that while innovations used to be focused on transportation, telecommuting is the new big thing.

With many areas participating in the eventual elimination of automobiles, many are following suit. Sociologists believe that cars will eventually disappear. By cutting down on our usage of cars, we help the enviromnent, promote health, and focus innovations elsewhere.",0
"Smog can be dangerous to people but also to buildings. It can also be hard for people to breathe in  smog and the buildings get damaged. Pollution is dangerous to the enviorment and people's car status.

First, smog can be dangerous to people and car status. For example, if people are walking and their is a lot of smog in the air, that can be bad for your lungs to breathe the in smog. The artice states ""when people breathe in smog they can develop respiratory problems such as bronchitits or even asthma."" So then if people keep on breathing in the smog, they will get sick and they will most likely have bad lungs. Secondly, pollution such as smog is bad for car status. On Carsdirect.com it says that one of the signs that your engine or cars status is bad is that, ""When you check your vehicle's oil, it's blackened and mucky from contamination of the oil from the combustion gases blowing by the piston rings."" So you know not to have alot of smog and pollution where you are driving and where your car is because then the status of your car will become awful.

Secondly, smog is not just bad for the environment and people, it's also bad for buildings. As stated in the artice pollution ""damages view of landmarks, contributes to climate change, and decreses air quality."" If you are around pollution then it just only gets worse. Pollution can be super close to an area, meaning that an area is always having pollution. So that is bad for people because that can also mean that pollution is increasing where you are, not decreasing. Additionally, smog and pollution are not just dangerous to people they are also dangerous to animals. Animals use the enviornment to eat and sleep. If the environment around the animals is having pollution then that will also affect the animals. So you need to watch out for animals and not have alot of smog. Lastly, smog affects human-made buildings.

Lastly, smog dosen't just affect nature around but buildings as well. In an area if that area has a place with lots of tall buildings and factories then they probably have a smog cloud above the buildings and aroud the factories. If a place has that then pollution needs to be reduced, all the buildings and factories need to be removed and the place can be another nature place again. If there is already smog or even a smog cloud by the buildings then you need to remove the buildings from the area. You need to limit where the pollution is and remove the stuff that is increasing the pollution. For example, in the article by CBS News, ""a smog-eating tower cleans 30,000 cubic meters of air each hour in 247 day year."" This is good for the environment because the pollution is decreasing by this engine of a building.

In conclusion, smog is not just bad for people but it is bad for the evironment. You need to limit your interaction with the enviornment when there is alot of pollution. Like I had said before, if there is pollution by a place like a car or anything with pollution, you need to remove that area from where you are. That way the building or area with lots of pollution can have less pollution. You need to reduce, reuse, and recycle the pollution.",1
"The face of Mars has been Mystery for many years. Ever sience the first picture of the face came out in 1976. Some people say it was made by aliens. While other say it is a natural rock formation. I am here to tell you that it is a nautral rock formation, by picture and other edivence.

The first pieace of edivence are the picture that were taken by Viking 1 and MGS, Mars Global Survey. In 1976 it looks like a face, but we didn't have the technology that we have. The first picture was 43 meters per pixel, which is a lot. Now if this technology advance we now get 1.56 meters per pixel, so if the face on Mars was really set up by aliens we would see their huts or anything else they built. The second piece of edivence is shadows, as you can see in the pictures it is just how the sun is position and how the statlite is postion to make it look like a face. The last reason is other natural sites that have the same size and looks like the face on Mars. The face on Mars reminds the Auroth of a place in Idaho. It is a Butte in the Snake river Plain. It is almost the same size and shape.

In conclusion the face of Mars is a natural site, and not made by aliens. I know because of the picture of the face of Mars. The new technology we used to get a better look at it. Lastly how other natural sites look like the face of Mars.",0
"I agree with everything but the fact that wasting money on a car just to drive it once a month is a problem, it should only be a few weeks where that is true. Limiting car usage has become a very popular and good thing to do. There are four very good reasons as to why limiting car usage is a very good thing to do, but one of them is also very bad.

The first very good reason as to why limiting car usage is that it would reduce inner city air pollution. In the documentary by Gary Hustwit it is stated that !""That urban car culture is destroying the environment,overtaking from the industry"". This is a very good point that is trying to persuade you to buy in to no new car day. This should be an official American holiday so that people must leave thier cars at home and not be able to drive on this day. It would be just like christmas where teen's would have to walk to school and parents walk or carpool going to and from work. Studies in los angelas has shown that more space hinder more cars. Which means that less space will mean no cars. A study in stubenville ohio said that in 2000 they had 2,000 people from 2000 to 2010 they were wanting to increase car usage, but instead there was a 50 percent decrease and gm had to close thier plant.

The second very good reason as to why limiting car usage is that it would decrease the average time for people in traffic. Within a few years Paris will be rid of all cars because it is going to increase pedestrian and public spaces. They said that ""Paris is full of innovation,and also limiting the automobile has been a big part of the mayors plan to improve the cities environment and livability. Meanwhile in Houston they were boosting thier car culture with bigger roads so more people would be on thier roads. But a judge ruled that thier car convienent was was unconstitutional as to not a thing anymore. But the fact that people bought fewer cars which was what the car makers wanted decreased because of this ""recession that has had a profound change in Americas driving habits. People are more willing to bike or walk or take public transtit, especially young people.""

The third very good reason ass to why limiting car usage is that it would also decrease fuel usage. In the articles it says ""The fact that we have had an actual reduction in driving in each of the last several years cannot be explained solely by economic factors"". Even though reducing fuel usage would be saving money it would also make the earth a better place. In Japan it is to expensive to own cars so it is wayical to have to bus ride. Another really cool example is that in dauhli china car are totally banned from thier cities and they have had a strong increase in people using the 17 public bus routes that they have.

The fourth and final reason that limiting car ususage should increase is that there would also be a decrease in the number of accidents including injuries and deaths. The fact that reducing the number of cars in a city would help the environment is shown when it says ""We are running out of nature,acreage is decreasing for almost everyone"". In the section under number of accidents it states ""Bogata now has a well-regarded bus system and a network of bike paths. There are still some projects to complete,like rebuilding homes by a new bikeway. But many residents say the improved life so far is worth the pain of the transition. We used to go outside and breathe, someone with asthma says, but we would vomit because of the stench. Now you can take a deep breath, and it is very pleasant. All of what they did in bogata was well worth it because people are starting to like it and it is getting better and more easy for the people of that country.

There are four good reasons as to why limiting car usage was a very good thing. The reasons are that it reduce inner city air pollution, decrease the average time people have being in traffic, decreases the amount of fuel that people are using, and it also decreases the amount of accidents. But remember also that there is one bad thing about all of what I just said that it goes back including driving once a month, and driving each year during this contest that Peyfon talks about in her articl.HandlerFuncing Driving.",1
"""But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling"", quote from the excerpt ""The End of Car Culture"", explains that people in the United States have started to become less dependent on cars. Not only Americans, but people all around the world such as people from Germany, France, etc. Reasonings for the recent drop in car usage is that there are problems with air pollution, bikes and other transportations that do not involve the use of cars also give place more space to make more town centers and sports complexes, and cars can be a very difficult machine that causes many problems for people everyday.

Smog has become a very big problem for France. France has blamed diesel fuel as the reason for the smog problems. Diesel is favored more than gasonline due to a tax policy, diesel makes up over 67 percent of vehicles in France. The smog in France was so heavy that it, ""rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"" according to an article by Robert Duffer. Smog is a very big issue that should not be taking place it can cause many health problems. France decided that the smog was getting out of hand so they began a ""Car-free day"", this meant that people would not be using their cars for a whole day and some people would not agree with this idea. France started these ""Car-free days"" with the people who had even numbered license plates and then the next day would have cars with odd numbered license plate would not drive their cars. The consequence for not following this rule was a $31.00 or 22-euro fine. Many people were fined the next few days and twenty seven people had their cars impounded due to their reaction of the fine. This ""Car-free day"" helped to reduce the smog problem in France.

When people use any type of transportation other than a car they would be able to have many more places to go and have a good time. When people are using cars and other motor vehicles they are also causing more and more construction for new roads and places for cars to be able to park. If people rode bikes and walked more than we would have more places for people to build shops and complexes that are all together and easy to get to. In Vauban, Germany most residents there live a life without the use of cars. ""The streets of Vauban are completely ""car-free""- except the main thoroughfare"", stated in the Article by Elisabeth Rosenthal. Only 30 percent of people in Vauban's familys own cars, the other 70 percent do not own cars. More than half of that 70 percent sold their cars just to live in Vauban. In Vauban they have begun to create more sidewalks that are better accesible for bikes and walking. This has created more room for people to construct new stores and places that are walkable distance for citizens, so less car usage could lead to many new places such as shops, stores and even new sports complexes.

Cars can be very difficult machines that cause many problems for people everyday. They can just stop in a matter of seconds and people would not know what happened, causing people to get their cars checked out at a car-shop and paying more money to get the problem fixed. If people began walking or using bikes as transportation they would not only be saving money but would lower the problems they would be having getting to and from places. Not using cars can save so much money for people because they would not have to pay much gas and they would not have to go to get their cars fixed almost every year. Even with bikes there might be a problem such as getting a flat tire or the chain popping off, even those little things would cost only a few dollars where as a trip to the car-shop would cost a least $100.00 out of pocket.

Limiting the use of cars can potentially save places from smog and more air pollution. Not using cars as much can leave more space for places to be built, instead of using the space as a parking lot people could use that space as a place for shopping or sports complex. Car-free day could even be a very helpful idea that might change the peoples minds to use other types of transportations besides a car. Having no cars could save a numerous amount of money for a lot of people. They will save money by not having to get a lot of gas and they will save money on not having to fix their cars almost every year. So limiting the use of cars could become a potential idea that can help people around the world.",0
"Sorts Cars

Should we get rid of the amazing and tech savvy invention of the car? This topic has been a controversial soutry of dibate in the past several years, and I will explain to you why we should. Every technological advacement we have has its advantages, and disadvantages. The cars were created in the early 1900's and have been increasingly advancing with new gearboxas, faster brakes, and expanding size ever since then. The main problems aruing with the cars is the pollution, growing size, and increasing population. So, should we limit ourselves with what we are capable of inventing just to keep a dateing that has been unapprfect for years; or, should we give up a disposing of technology that has one small reason for dispostal.

The first subject that I will talk about is the irrefutable pollution that is caused by cars every day. If you did not know, almost if not every car, runs on gasoline. Gasoline is a highly flamable liquid that is used to power cars, but it also has its downsides much like anything else. Cars produce a good ammount of pollution evertime gasoline is burned by the engine, and this has been the number one pollutant of the air ever since the invention of the car. The United States the country that is dependant on cars for transportation, is selling 12.3 million barrels of petroleum ever few weeks. Now, we have had several ways to decrease this number, but most people hardly leave their car for any reason; they drive into work or to school, then back home into the driveway. The limiting of cars was agreed on by the people in Europe to the point of people getting rid of the cars that they already owned. According to the New York Times after the conflict between israel and Lebanon when they banned cars, they had less carner citys because not that many people live in the country and take more vacations, and cars because less people own them. The second subject to consider if you are not convinced is the unstable population. We have no more room in urban areas for larger roads, and our smaller side streets and very narrow. We are already running into many problems as is, with the increasing amount of driver distractions like texting, and people who already can't drive properly and cause crashes, and possible the roads are destroyed. America is the country that is worth trillions of dollars because we are the most wealthy, and we have the best roads. But what if our road cannot handle what it was meant for any longer, eventually so much will cause decline in the worth of the country. But, if we get rid of cars, what are we supposed to use instead? We can use possibly the greates invetion of the 21'st century, the smartphones. Already in 2011 the us got rid of the amount of cars because more and more people there want to drive less, car companies in the united states had their second worse year for selling cars, and the number of people ages 14 to 34 who did not obtain a license grew to 21 percent.

The second subject that I would like to talk to you about is the growing population reason for people who are against human cars. The ever increasing and very unstable population of the world has caused many problems. Problems that are constantly getting worse like less food availability, and more car accidents. The problems are becoming more apparent, and we need a longer term solution to solve them, Before the effects become near unbearable, or cause the extinction of some living species. In not many nations across the world will you see people riding in a car, they will  see you walking from one place to another. In some countires car are ben because either the advantage of getting rid of them is too high, or because of the amount of injuries and deaths that occur from car wrecks.

﻿ In conclusion, with the amount of good things to come from removal of cars much exceed the low amount of bad things. Countries all around the earth are removing the use of certain things, using more of the use of others just to either make profit or get away from some trouble. But did you know one of the wealthiest countries in the world France has made it illegal to drive cars in a new town called Viaganino? You cant keep going with everything that has been created over all the years we have had, somethings have to go, and in this cade the cars should.",1
"Technology now and days can be very amusing and fun to play with such as an, I phone or any phone generally but now it's getting to the point where it's becoming a weapon. These past years a lot of teenagers were killed because of people using their phones while driving. Most people think they know how to text and drive but they don't. I don't think people should use their phones and drive even if they think they know how to, anything can happen in a split second.

Texting & driving is more debilitating to your reaction time than driving while under the influence of alcohol. As crazy as it sounds its true people tend to crash more likely while using a device and driving than under the influence. We are so focused on social media or other people texting us that most of the time we aren't paying attention to the road. Even if you're at a red light and you use your phone your still most likely to crash because of the fact of the fact that you're not aware when the light turns green. If you simply cannot resist the urge to check messages or talk on the phone while driving, take the time to pull off of the roadway and park your vehicle before picking up your cell phone.

Driving other people in your vehicle is a huge responsibility, which most of teenagers take that lightly. Sending or reading a text message while driving puts your passengers lives at a significantly higher risk of being involved in an accident while riding in your vehicle. Could you live with the fact that your decision to pick up your phone while Driving someone to suffer a life-lasting injury or be killed? Humans are smaller and less noticeable than vehicles making it more likely of you seeing a pedestrian in your peripheral vision while looking at your phone.

In most states texting and driving is illegal but people don't care and continue doing it. If you are caught by the police using your mobile device and obtaining a vehicle at the same time, most likely you're going to get a couple hundred dollars fine. Looking at a message that says ""ok"" isn't worth getting in trouble with the law.",0
"Unlike cars, the use of the Volkswagon driven by Motor Trend for Day 10 of thier test inticating reduced smog forming emissions to enter the atmosphere. Although, most people drive around in cars they are oblivious to the harm they are inticating such as evironmental pollutants. Though society has become reliable on cars the lack of usage of cars cound decrease the injured accident rate and reduce the tension of having smooshed cars and also might increase the physical activity of indivisuals that are remaining healthy by excericing daily. So, depending on your perspective you can criticize the driving ban or you can apprectiate finding the strong and weak sides of banning driving of cars.

Categroizing and banning the use of certain things can be appreciatied or it can be disliked. Regarding some people about the ban of the driving car they were displeased due to the fact that people were having to take public transportation even though the most individuals that went on the busses had to deal with teh crowds. But, the people that fail to notice the positive aspects were focusing on the negative parts of the ban including the huge traffic that resulted in some parts of certain areas they called a ""carmaggedon"" an example could be an average Los Angelos inhabitat. Comparatively, the ban could have the same results as it did in a French city who went from deting daily fines from having the ban to ending the driving ban due to people were complaining about the fine of  ""32 Euros"". Thus, just like the French city a caution driving ban could be criticized and stopped because of what transpired.

Of course there are many valid points of reasonong to the driving ban of cars, but there can always be another side of the reasoning that we do not tend to observe. For instance, there are various positive aspects of the driving ban that the visitors and residentsof Paris did not even notice due to their excitable emotions of receiving a fine for not using their cars. However, in Paris the percent of the inhabitants who commonly used their cars dropped from fifty nine percent to 45 percent in peak driving period and the amount of cars had a significant decrease of 225,000 during the campaign and about 363 people received a warning and had to pay a 22 euro fine. Although it may not mean the same in Paris, over the course of month or year for French residents they could reflect upon what had happened in the society as a whole they could strive for change and become a society that Amercians would enjoy. To sum it up, there are various substantial reasons for why there was a a driving of carban including the percentage of peolpe commonly using cars decreased, the amount of cars in Paris decreaed and the people of Paris was changing to become a better society by reflecting on our society as Americans.

Ending the driving of cars there are numerous strong reasons, however the means one may percieve the reasoning depends on them and their experiences due to the fact taht different people look at occurences at a variance. One may criticize the driving ban and another may apprectiate such bvecause of the value that he or she places on the ban of the driving of cars.",1
"Boom the sound of ginourmous truck slamming into a house full of people , smoke everywere there's about to be a fire many people are unconcious or dead. More than half of the people in the house are rushed to the hospital. As you can see there has been an atrocious accident because of that vehicle. Their should definitley be a limiting of car usage because their would be less car accidents , people would be able to spend less money on cars and we would have less air pollution. Also having a car can cause a lot of stress or tension for people.

Obviously we're having a lot of problems with money in this world , if we limit car usage that would really help is us out a lot. See as it states in source one paragraph two '' A car-owner buys a space, for forty thousand dollars , along with a home.'' With those forty thousand dollars you can do a lot to help the world . It aslo says that fifty seven percent of the people who live in a suburban area sold their cars just move where they live at now. Who needs a car when you can just walk ''stores are placed a walk away, on a main street rather than the malls along some distant highway. ''source one paragraph 6.

Pollution is destroying our world and we need to help stop it, so here's an idea lets ban driving due to smog says Paris. Their was an enforced partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Do you agree with that? well I do and here's why . Paris has more smog than other European capitals so if they don't stop the smog it's going to be horrific for their city. Source three paragraph twenty one '' the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.'''Not having cars for one day is brilliant idea because is an improvement to the city of Bogota.

Their is a lot of disruptions an accidents going on because of cars mainly because of the traffic so if their was less cars it would be more peaceful. Usually when there's traffic you hear a lot honking and there's a lot fines for that. The fines are very expensive to pay so you're wasting a lot of money. Also when people are honking they don't realize that other people are sleeping . Everyone needs sleep , some people can't sleep through everything so all it takes is one honk and bam they're awake. Sleeping is really needed in your life imagine notgetting enough sleep because of traffic well yeah that would suck an a lot of people already go through that .

So in conclusion what I'm saying is car usage should definitly be limited at least in some countries or states. Money is a really big problem we have that needs to be solved and this is a great way. People living in a surburan area have to pay more just for extra parking places. Air pollution is very bad for the world with les cars that will stop as well. Traffic is not good for the world either because it is stressful an it is not good for people to be stressed.",0
"Cahokia is the most advanced emplacement and the most densely populated in North America outside of Mexico. It is importeant to historians and scientists because it was a multicultural civilization. Cahokia had a long distance trade that included items from mountains, deserts, and the Gulf of Mexico basin from 1000 AD until its decline in 1400 AD. They were located in the Mississippi River floodplain in modern day southern Illinois and went into Collinsville near Cahokia high school. I agree with William Cell that the Cahokia site was a very remarkable site and it was important to historians and scientists.

First, Cahokia was a multiculutral civilization. They have found objects such as shells, copper, mica, and something from an ocean that was far away from North America. Veracruz, Mexico is where the people from the Twilight movies lived and the place is known for its significant contact with the vast regions of Mesoamerica. Cahokia is like Witch Creek, a disadvantage of one category and upstander of the other. Witch creek had all young males in the single demographic they had a shooting spree then ended with a crash and a few others died. Cahokia had Mound 72 that had several layers ceremonial structures with goods and burials.

Next, Cahokia had a long distance trade. The trade route included mountains, deserts, and the Gulf of Mexico basin. They found pottery that was near Greak cliff dwellings in Guadalupe, New Mexico. THey found shells from the water that was Traditionally the signpost for the Mississippian world belief in a place of at the confluence of the Earth's major waters. They found a flint claymade effigy that were never available in the vicinity of Cahokia. They found chunck of coppper, ax of water and a hat of atlantie from the Mexico basin in Cahokia. There were a multiple category of imports including mica from the lowermost southeastern United States.

Finally, the Sacrionic site of Cahokia was large and advanced. They had a human population that was between 65000 and 120000. They had monumental buildings,some of which were on the scale of the Maya or ancient Egyptians. They had social complexity and exlarged trade that was reflected in the presence of elite personages and their goods, such as embanted warriors. The population of Cahokia was larger than London at the time. The manmade North American old is not disease free. They had low populations before the Europeans explorers came to avoid diminishing population. Critics have oversimplified the comparison between the American east and the east a of Paris at the time.

In conclusion, Cahokia was very important to historians and scientists because they were a mulitcultural civilization, they had a long distance trade, and Cahokia was a large and advanced site. They found a variety of things at Cahokia that supported that they were very well advanced. From one category they were more advance than the other but they were the upstander from the other and they allowed people to come to Cahokia.",1
