"Have we seen any form of life on Mars so far? No, that's why it's clearly a natural landform. Plus, how do the aliens know what we look like. They could look completely different from us. It just so happens that the natural landform look's like a face.

Why would the aliens spend their time making a two mile long face anyways? These natural landform's are common in Cydonia, only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoh. It is indeed interesting and cool to think that it was built by aliens, but it wasn't built by aliens. Don't get me wrong, everyone wishes it was made by aliens, but facts are facts.

In 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over the landmark and got a couple photo's that are ten times better than the 1976 photo's. It was confirmed that the landmark wasn't a face it was just the shadow's that made it look like a face. But of course, skeptics thought the alien markings were hidden by haze. ""It's not easy to target Cydonia"" says Garvin. ""In fact, it's hard work.""(Paragraph 9)

Then, on April 8, 2001, four years after the last photo, another couple of photo's were taken. These photo's were way clearer than the photo's from 1998. "" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" Garvin added. "" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This is proof that aliens did not make this landform.

As you can see, there is plenty of edvidence that the two mile head is a natural landform. Their is way more convicing stories about this topic. But I hope that my side of the argument conviced you that the landform wasn't built by aliens.",0
"According to the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."" This planet is worthy of the risks and issues of exploration. While the author maintains to cross his point, he uses evidence and facts to change the readers' ideas of this messy planet, by comparing it to more similar terms that are more pleasent to the reader.

First the author starts by explaining and describing the unabitable conditions of the planet. The author states that ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth;"" Which are refering to the extreme temperatures of ""average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and the ""thick atmosphere of almost 97 percentage carbon dioxide blankets."" Second he follows to counterclaim his points by questioning, ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing fursther visits to its surface?"" This persuades the reader to question themselves, What is so bad about Venus? or more important What is so good about Venus? Which he replays and answers by comparing, once again, Venus with our own planet, Earth. He states that, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Changing the reader's idea or previous image, that he already provided, passing from an ""inhospitable planet"" to a planet that ""was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life.""

In conclution the author crosses his point by using evidence of a very dangerous, and unabitable planet, and what it once was and how similar it was to what is now our Earth, or also ""Venus' twin."" As a way to persuade the reader into believing that Venus is worthy of its investigations.",0
"Changing our ways on how we use cars for the better? Is it just so happen that people are using there car less than usual? In many places like Germany, Paris, Bogota are changing the ways to use cars. To reduce every little problem cars are causing. Traffic jams, smogs, and reducing greenhouse gas emmisions, people are getting smart about using there cars everyday. Maybe people are tired of using all cars of the time.

When people buy car, it gives them alot of freedom knowing they area able to go where ever they're heart desires. Lately people aren't feeling the whole waiting in traffic if theres an accident or just to much cars. Bus rides, trains, taxi are helping reduce this. People can go somewhere without waiting that long just for a little price. In Germany there are new laws where they put a prices to put cars and there is only certian places you can put there cars at. 70% of families in Germany have do not own cars and 57% sold there cars because of this new law? YouÂ  would think thats people would complain about having cars and having no place to put them. But many people are accuatly happy that they put this new type of law. Many people prefered to have this happen.

Smogs? what are smogs? smogs are grey clouds that hurt is in ways we dont even know. Cars emmit these deadly gases and we dont know it. Cars arent the only one who emmit they clouds of grey smoke, factories emmit this also. Which is not helping our ecosystem at all. In Paris they had an order to help redude this problem. On mondays motorists with even-numbered liscense plates were ordered to leave their cars at home which on the following day people with odd numbered liscenes plates were doing the same thing if they did not follow this ruling they were have to suffer a thirty one dollar fine. This helped alot with the smog.

Places like Germany and Paris arent the only one who are changing the ways. In Bogota they have a car free day which only allows you to take a bicycle, taxi, buses or whatever you want but do not take a car or suffer the rath of fine. Going on for three years now people are saying they enjoy these types of days because everything is more relaxing it reduces stress and air pressure which is a really good thing. Even when it rains it doesn't stop people from participating from this. There is even a 118 mile bicycle path that shows how much people want to change the way they use cars. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city: uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaces by broad, snooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""

Many sciencetists are believing that the car culture is coming to an end. Cars sales have drop alot. People are taking the bus, taxis, and even trains to avoid traffic. ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn."" Younges ages don't even drive till the age of 21 or they don't even care till then. They can usually care poll to places like partys, mall and the beach. They don't need a seperate car for each person when they are all going to the same place. Which is feel its a good and bad things. Its good because poeple are caring more that were causing harm to our own home and that they know that they can do all they want together and still have fun. It causes harm to busineses many stores could go out of business.

It does not matter if we try to stop using cars or not we are always hurting in some other way. Traffic jams, smogs and reducing greenhouse emmisions are just the begining of this all. We can do way more if we put out mind set to it.",0
"Cars most are used by workers, mothers, and pretty much all people in any urban area, they get us from point A to point B. But, as much as we use automobiles do we really need them? They produce smog, endanger our children and folk, and make life more stressing for us all. This can be fixed though, many places around the world have stoped using cars and even went to the length of banning them! Most importantly though they have opened our eyes to the atmospheric destruction that is caused by cars and ways we can do without them.

In Paris, a few days after nearrecord pollution, France banned driving for a couple days to clear the air or drivers will be fined up to 22 euros, or 31 dollars in America. ""Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying in smog that rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world,"" says Robert Duffer, a journalist for Paris Robert Duffer, par. 14. This amazing number just shows how even reducing the use of cars cut back the smog by over half! Imagine what our air could be like if we didn't use cars, it would help the ill and our children could breathe easily. And surprisingly enough, there are places already that do this act of banning cars and enforce it.

In Vauban, Germany there is a community of people who live in this fashion. Street parking, garages, and even driveways at homes are banned from this quaint suburban area. And, if you do own a car you have to pay almost 40,000 to park it, needless to say over 70% of families of the area don't own a car and 57% sold theirs to move to the area. A mother of two and resident of the area, Heidrun Wlater, says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" Elisabeth Rosenthal par. 3. And true to their word these kinds of urban areas have become popular in Europe and even in New York.

Car free areas have not been limited to just Europe though in America, with its large areas of urban annd suburban ideals, is now changing the way the way we think about cars. In April 2013, the miles driven per person was 9% lower than it was in January 1995 32. Although small, this cultural change in the way we are using cars is significant. Michael Sivak, a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute says, ""What most intrigues me is that the rates of car ownershipper household and pe person started to come down 2 or 3 years before the downturn, I think that means something more fundamental is going on,"" Elisabeth Rosenthal par. 33. The fact that America is changing the way we use cars is just another indicator that we should stop all together and join this carfree revolution.

To wrap it up, cars are hurting the air and they need to be cut back before we burn a hole through our atmoshpere. We're not alone in this carfree quest, many areas Europe and nothern America have started to implement this way of thinking. And lastly, this ideal is most needed in America's packed cities, the hazzard of smog and other pollution is hurt our citizens and needs to be stoped before it has longterm effect on our children. Please consider this, car in the long run are bad for the economy but, as well our health. It's snowing on Mt. Fuji.",0
"Few Nasa scientists believe that the face on Mars was created by aliens. To be scientifically correct, the face is actually just a huge rock formation which are commonly found on Earth. There is no evidence supporting the clame that aliens created that landform on Mars.

Scientists have proved that the face on Mars was created by a huge rock formation. The image taken on Mars in 1998 revealed that the face is really just a natural landform. Therefore, there was no alien monument after all. Perhaps people wanted to think the face on Mars was created by aliens just so it couold be a good story for a magazine or Hollywood film, but that is not true. Scientists have revealed how the landfrom is equivalent to a butte or a mesa, which are commonly found on Earth.

With the evidence provided from scientists, the claim that aliens made the face on Mars has been proved incorrect. There is no evidence that prove that the landfrom has been created by aliens. In conclusion, aliens did not make the landform on Mars.",0
"The author say that venus is called the ""evening star"". venus is actually a planet. venus is the second sun planet from the sun. also venus is the twin of earth. venus is one of the closest planets to earth. both has the same density and size.

venus mission is was unmanned and no spacecraft survived the landing no spaceships arrived on venus for ""3 decades""many factors said that venus is an challenging planet for humans to study .planet temps are up to 800 degrees fahrenheit. the atmospheric pressure is is 90 times greater .venus has the hottest surface tempture then any planet there is. it presents additional impedimits like natural desaters .for example strong eartquakes and erupting valcanoes .

Mean while NASA is working on ways to study venus.""for examples ,some simplified elctronics made of silicons carbide habe been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of benus surface and have lastd three weeks in such conditions"". they've also been looking back at old technologycalled mechanicsl computers. Those items were invented in the 1800's .played a role during the 1940's during world war ll .the materials made caculations by using gear and levers. none used electronics. meeting the challenge presented by venus has value because human curiosity will likely lead into many equal intimidating endeavors.",0
"Should humans be able to use cell phones while driving

Humans should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle because it can cause accidents, and even worse death. The National Safety Council today called on state and federal lawmakers to ban the use of cell phones and text-messaging devices while driving. Due to the number of accidents that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal.

A study from the Harvard Center of Risk Analysis estimates that cell phone use while driving contributes to 6 percent of crashes, which equates to 636,000 crashes, 330,000 injuries, 12,000 serious injuries and 2,600 deaths each year. Due to the number of accidents that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal. Cell phone use contributes to 6% of crashes, and drivers are at a four times greater risk of a crash.

Smartphones have made it easy for us to stay connected at all times. But that can pose serious safety risks if someone decides to check his or her text messages, emails, phone calls, or any other mobile applications while driving. Cell phone distraction rates are alarmingly high. Worst of all, the usage of cell phones before car accidents happen is known to be underreported due to potential legal issues. Using a mobile phone while driving is reckless behavior, and every single crash that happens due to it can be prevented.

The safest possible way to use a cell phone while driving would be to attach it to the radio system or another suitable hands free device via Bluetooth. The hands free device does not guarantee safety either. While the distraction from using such technology is significantly smaller, it might still cause an accident. So there is no better decision than to simply postpone calls until you have arrived at your destination.

In conclusion, humans should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle because it can cause accidents, and even worse death. Using cell phones while driving can put us at great risk, so just wait until you get to your destination",0
"Cars are going to be gone in the near future. There have been talks and actions taken place to assure we limit our car usage. We as the

United States seem to have pasted our use for cars as independent owners. We have also started several different programs or actions around the world to assure we stop pollution with the use of cars. Another way we have stop the use of car is car free days in some parts of the world. Also cars are believe to be stressful to human beings.

In some parts of the world mainly Bogota, Colombia they have start to reduce the use of cars to avoid pollution and promote the use of other types of transportation. As it is stated in source 3

:

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Selsky "" The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.""Â  This quote goes to show how we are starting to try to limit the usage of vehicles in this world. Also stated in source 2

:

Paris bans driving due to smog by Duffer ""Paris enforced a partial diving ban to clean the air of the global city. On Monday motorists wit even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" this shows that Paris even supports the limiting car usages by humans.

Therefore us as the United States we have shown that even we are behind in our glory days of driving cars. As stated in source 4

:

The End of Car Culture by Rosenthal "" recent studies suggest that Americans as buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" So with that have been said we need to understand we drive no matter what but slow but surely we will stop driving in general. Due to the fact of that we do need to decrease our carbon release a pond the world. As it also states from article 4

or source 4

""If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind the power plant."" This quote shows how it will affect us and also how it will benefit us as well.

Although driving feels amazing it gives you tons of stress to an individual. Not only that but it also makes you sometimes want to hurt someone. As well as feeling upset and sometimes wanting to cry due to a lack of funds to pay for gas as well as the worry of other drivers on the road. As stated in source 1

:

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Rosenthal a man states ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter. This goes to show us how we are affected by riving and even a little time away from the wheel can benefit us greatly. Another point on driving is stressful a man states in source 3

:

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota heÂ  states It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" said Carlos Arturo Plaza. This goes and show a lot of people are in support of this act or idea.

In conclusion limiting car use will benefit us in many ways but barely affect us at all. The main idea is to limit car usage and we can do that by the law that forces us stop car use in general. Another way we can accomplish this is by being an average teen in the United States.Â  An added bonus is that we have loads of stress by driving. The limiting the use of driving is a way we should use to benefit us as human and to be more joyful.",0
"The Face is actually a natural landform. It's a huge rock formation which is also common in the American West. It's proven by Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbit Camera because it's ten time sharper than the orginal. All this mostly proves that it's not an alien monument.

When NASA reveal the image for everyone to see, the authors thought it's a good way to engage attention on Mars. According to the text, it stated, "" huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadoes giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This caption have brought attraction on Mars and books, magazines, radio talk shows, and Hollywood film has starred.

Most of the people thought of an alien comparacy but when Malin and his MOC team snapped a better view of it, it proves it wasn't an alien monument. According to the text, it stated, "" And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a oicture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.

If it's not an alien monument, what is it? Garvin said it was a landform which reminds him of mostly Middle Butte. According to the text it stated,"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.""

The picture is a landform after all. Most might be disappointed that it's not an alien monument. It's also been proven by the pictures over the year they had taken of which mostly is not an alien monument. Again, it's a picture of a butte or mesa, which are common around the American West.",0
"Facial Action Coding Systems can be a really good addition to the classroom. This technology can help teachers and staff see what a student is going through and if they need help. This could also help students show a teacher or staff memeber if they need help but don't know how to ask.

Facial Action Coding Systems is a program that lets a computer read human emotion and can show statistics of how you are feeling this is support by the quote, ""She's eighty-three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and two percent angry. No, that's not your science teacher,grading your latest lab assignment. Its the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa at least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotion."" The software can help teachers actually help students with mental health instead of writing them a slip and just saying you are fine. Also teachers can tell you how to coop with certain stresses bust by scaning you with a computer program. This can also help teachers find the student that caused trouble if they are not cooperating, because the program can tell if the subject is lying or not. This claim is supported by the following quote. "" To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clies are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" polictician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" The program can also help schools by seeing if a student is under a lot of pressure and needs help right away.

The overall claim is that I believe that Facial Action Coding System program can really improve mental stability with students and solve disputes between them. The system can really help teachers find out what students need help if they are afraid to reach out. The Facial Action Coding System program could be a really good addition to classrooms.",0
