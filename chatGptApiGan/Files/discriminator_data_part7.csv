"In the article ""Should We Use $700 Computers to Help Us Learn Math?"", a math teacher Mark Davidson is trying to explain to the school bored at his middle school that computers would really help the students out by having one themselves. Davidson gose and checks out the computer before he ask's the school bored. He uses the software by Stanford Mathematician Conrad Wolfram he wrote to teach his young daughter math. In the artice Davidson quotes ""I'm doing math constantly, but all I'm really doing is supplying a tool for math doing-and-learning that's personal."" The reason why the teacher is all for the computers is because a child can go out and get a personal math tool like a calculator to use in class to do math, but you wouldn't take out your calculator to do a quick math problem on the go. The student can take out his computer to do the math problem quickly. The artice suggests that the students should get a computer.

I think that the students should be aloud to recieve a computer because like the artice says it gives you the feeling of an accomplishement for your own tool that would be your personal math tool. I agree with Davidson saying that as a math teacher this would not be a good ideal messase to tell your students about math. I was was reading this article and thinking how crazy it is that this is even a questioned asked, because of course as a student I would want a new laptop after reading that yes there are cons about the laptops, but i'm going to use technology someday when I have a probabley a child and I do no't want them to take the middle school exit exam just so they can have a laptop all because I can't trust my own child with a math equation. Think about how quick this world is evolving today by just technology. Lets say the student have a bestfriend who doesn't learn as quickly as you and has no computer who you allow to share a locker with to get his books between every class not only would that be a struggle because we student's have became so glued to looking at a screen ALL day. Cars are also evolving by speed limits sure the driving age is 16, but more then half of high school students might not even be driving to school because they can stay home doing homework until it's time for the bus to pick them up unless you live really close to the school. That's all the students will be on for the ride is to look out the window, but look how this world is evolving it might not be faults in like 3-4 decades nobody wants to go out and play aka do somthing besides stay home attached to a SCREEN little kids now only even know how to communicate by texting because of how much they love technology. So as a math teacher Mr. Davidson wants a laptop because it will supply his work, home, his own children and students with technology for math. Better yet laern how to operate surely there will be struggles the more you go on the more you'll adjust and limit your way of destracting yourself so I think that if the school command gets the laptops it should have a nice reward for not allowing students to be on them. That is my opinion in the questioned asked. Are Laptops Good Enought for Our Students?",1
"Space travel is something we people of Earth have just only begun to tinker with. Even after our many launches of aircrafts into the atmosphere, we know very little of what it truly out in the endless void of space. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus specifically is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author would be correct in this statement as we humans know very little about the planet because of numerous factors making it a difficult planet to study, but solving those problems would lead into advancement. Including that becuase the planet is closely related to earth, that could mean it supported life long ago. Lastly that striving to meet the challenge presented, despite the roadblocks, would lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

The planet in space we call Venus has a reputation for how troubling it is to study because of numerous factors. As included in the article, Venus has ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets...clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid...planet's surface tempurature average of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit...Atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater..."" Venus is an extremely difficult planet to study which is why it would be such an amazing goal to study it fully. If NASA and the people of Earth fight to overpower these issues, we would advance as a species, developing more solutions to fight these problems. By facing the problems presented by Venus, we would finally be able to study it and even find out is there is, or was life on Venus.

In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author stated that ""Astromoners are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Shortly after this, they also stated that ""Long ago, Venusm was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" The search for life in space has been one outrageously demanded by the public and Venus may very well be the place to look, after we can penetrate the bounderies it has in store. It was even stated in the article that Venus even has features extremely similar to some found on Earth, furthering the support that Venus could have or does support life. Regardless if Venus supports life or not, if we as a species can get past the barriers of Venus, would lead us into many equaly intimidating endeavors that we can surpass.

The author sugests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and supports that when they say, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equaly intimidating endeavors."" They also say in the next sentence ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" By surpassing the challenge of Venus, we will have the technology an wisdom to surpass other difficult challenges we may encounter, overall gaining the knowledge and power to gain more knowledge and power.

The exploration of Venus is indeed a difficult and dangerous task, but in the end would be worth while. By advancing our technologies we can bypass the dangers of Venus and pave the road to move onto even more dangerous and difficult tasks, both on out planet and outside our planet. We could gain the knowledge of how similar Earth and Venus are, finalizing if it could have or did support life at one point in time. And the factors making Venus so dangerous, would be minimalized and surpassed.",0
"Yes, Curriculum-Based Measurements is a capable of measuring the influence of classroom teaching on intelligence. I know this because that is what the article tells. In one of the paragraphs it tells that most schools in cities across the nation where tutoring has thrived in California have adopted the very regimen hoarded by these companies, known as ""mastery based learning. The premise is simple but powerful: the best way to prepare students for the next grade level is to make sure that they have mastered the material from the current one. This information came from lines forty to sixty-six. So by what it is saying is that we are trying to teach students more deeply and differently.

But in America students are tested in reading and math in a classroom every two years to compare schools. Computerized ""adaptive learning as exemplified by the Measures of Academic Progress test, is booming, moving from K-12 classrooms into college as well. Eight million students now take the Northwest Evaluation Association test in all fifty states, making it one of the country's most adminstered exams. It isn't surprising that parents and educators are asking that it now assess the unique qualities of a school's program.

Only recently did Kathy Horvat, a curriculum coordinator for the Broward County School District, which includes Fort Lauderdale, learn that the MAP test provided scores on specific skills. Rather than dismissing it as just another big test, she wondered if it could be used for more than ratings. She's still not sure, she says. Teachers covet the bright red, yellow and green dots that indicate student proficiency, because ""that's what we've always had."" Yet Horvat is intrigued by the idea of a skill-focused diagnostic. This is found in lines ninety-four to one hundred and eighteen. It is a question that is stated but not answered in the article.

The article does do a great job of giving you plenty of information to back up both sides of the argument on whether you can measure classroom teaching on intelligence. The author gave lots of examples in the article. He also did a great job giving lots of different peoples point of view on this argument.",1
"Phones and Driving

Look around you! All you see is people from all ages staring at a device all day which is a phone. People are always stuck on their phones, that it seems they can never let it go while:working ,at school,cleaning,and driving. Some things caused by using your phone while driving are car accidents, irresponsible people driving, or you can get a fee.

Phones can be such a distraction to everyone at anytime including while driving which is a safety hazard. A major cause of deaths in the US is motor vehicle accidents because of phone usage most of the time. ""About 33,700 people die in motor vehicle each year"" shown on CDC. This means that some of the accidents are from phone usage and other factors, but if people stop using their phones while driving their could be less accidents in the future. In the article ""Mobile phones and driving safety"", it stated that,""In a 2011 study it was reported that over 90% of college students surveyed texts (initiate,reply,or read) while driving."" It proves that even adults can be immature that they use their phones while driving even when knowing the possible consequences they may have. If people continue to use phones while driving then the rate of death will get higher and people would think that nothing will happen to them while using their phones.

Many people may say that teens are the ones driving irresponsibly by using their phones when operating a vehicle. In reality, everyone from every age is irresponsibly driving. According to an article of "" Teen driver source"", ""In 2015, 42 percent of high school students who drove in the past 30 days reported sending a text or email while driving.""The other half were most likely adults in which adults should set younger people an influence because they learn from them. In another passage on ""Science Daily' stated that, adults are always on their phone while driving with young kids either by sending a text, reading texts, on social media, or their just distracted driving. I believe that the adults should be more cautious including the teens but adults tend to have younger kids with them in the car.

Both the adults and teens are guilty of driving on their phones, but they should learn sooner to avoid any type of tragedy.

Each state in the US has their own laws to protect their people. Since some don't listen the people in charge of the state they've made laws for people who drive careless. About 43 states have prohibited drivers to text or even be on their phones (Facts & Statistics about texting and driving). Even though not all states have been prohibited of being on their phones, almost all of them have which is a good difference. In some states if the police stops you for the first time for texting and driving, you can get a fee depending where you live. For example, Georgia has a fee of $150, Florida has one of $30,and New Jersey has one of $400. The fee law is a good option because if they stop you a second time then you could have jail time if you didn't learn the first time from the fee. If the US keeps making stricter laws of being on the phone while driving then the people will learn.

In conclusion, driving while using your phone at any age isn't right. By one simple distraction something tragic could occur. It's not always teens driving reckless, but if anyone act young by not responsibly driving then they could get a fee they have to pay. Driving while using the phone should be taken more serious to prevent any issues.",0
"Pets are the best source of entertainment and joy for everyone. Their flexibility towards all types of people be it kids or old people, makes them even more valauable then friends. But sometimes these pets dies or get lost and we can't help ourselves but cry and be upset about it. The car manufacturer ""Subaru"" came up with this interesting idea where they used kawartha pets, animatronics cats and dogs, to test their safety features. They also brought in pasion for the client's safety, not only through their products but by stating in their invite: ""We build the safest cars for your most precious cargo."" In conclusion if having your old drog Rocky or your spikey Sally means not getting your car for cheaper then that's the choice you should make since even if they might not be humans but they're lovables animals that we treat as memebers of our family.",1
"Many people use cars to get from one place to another,but however, many states around the world are having people not using cars. In other words, many states are car free states and this has changed many cultural changes in the sociey that the people live in. Not using any cars provides many beneficial factors to not only the enviroment but to the people too and here's why. Having car-free states reduces car emission and can provide healthier productive lives of exercise. This change to the world can inspire lots of people and open up the doors of nature's beauty to provide a peaceful way of living to the enviroment of the world.

We use cars everyday in our lives from going to resteraunts, jobs, homes, schools,ect. However, do we ever think that whenever we drive we are causing more pollution to spread from every mile we go? Cars are the number one leading pollution emission enviroment destroyers in the world. This pollution causes many close suburban areas with homes around to breathe in gas emission from cars. This is absolutely not healthy at all to many people. For example, in the article written by Robert Duffer in his title, ""Paris bans driving due to smog."" States that, ""[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particular matter (PM) per cubic meter..."" That is more toxin to inhale that could possibly kill you! There are countries, for instance, like Germany that have some cities ""car-free"" as an experimental way to stop pollution emission and traffic jams causing loud noises to some close spaced suburban areas. Now, instead of using cars the people living in Germany are walking, riding bikes, or using trams to get from one place to another. So far, the people do not mind having any cars around and they even say they are happy and like the new change on where they live. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" says Heidrun Walter from the article by Elisabeth Rosenthal titled, ""Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars."" So whenever you first sit in a car think about what you are about to do and think about how you can benefit yourself and the world by not spreading pollution emission from cars.

Many people want to exercise, stay fit, and lose weight depending on what they want to do. Some people like to jog or run to go to there jobs as a productive way to not use there cars but to get out and exercise more. Many people around the world perfer not to use cars but instead use any-other means of transportation to either make themselves healthy or to not use any means of spreading pollution. In fact many people that live in big cities such as New York and San Francisco with more cars driving in the population. Have young people from 16-39 year olds that don't have a drivers license use other means of transportation to benefit themselves. In the article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal titled, ""The End of Car Culture."" States that, ""They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends."" People ages from 16-39 year olds are not caring about using cars or getting a drivers license but using any other means of transportation even if it is longer way to get to a destination. This is very beneficial for young people of 16-39 year olds to have healthy lives at a young age so they can live longer and they can feel good about themselves.

Can you see now why having no cars as the means of transportation is a good thing? Many people are having healthier lives and live on not using pollution but using other means of transportation. People in many states and countries are happy with this change for the better as new meaning of change in cultural experiences. Now, are you able to change just like the people living the ""car-free"" life around the world?",0
"I do not beleive that it is possible to determine someones emotions based on the world-limitied picture. I believe this because although a picture is worth a thousand words what if those words are the wrong interpretation of the image. My last reason is that something might be affecting their emotional facial expression that you cannot see.

A picture is worth a thousand words but whos to say that this thousand words worth of writing is everything that the person is feeling and more. When we look at pictures we usually notice the obvious rather then the little detail. A human face has many features that can give away a persons emotions. You look at the obvious that is staring you right in the face and dont think about the fact of what if that isn't a correct interpretation. Lets take the picture of a landslide what would be your interpretation? I would see it as a beautfiful display of mother nature's fury, but I do not know that the house in the bottom is mine and that this is a very destructive image. On the outside it is extremely beautiful and elegant even breathtaking, but on the inside the home is falling apart and being destoryed.

Although there is the statement of a picture is worth a thousand words there is also another point of view to see this from. We know that the words would all be wrote in interpretation on the persons feelings. Lets take the picture of the Zhangjiajie National Park with the glass plateau walkway. What would be your interpretation of this picture? Most people would see it as a beautiful nature shot of clouds and a mountian with a ""literal""(which would be the visible meaning of the emotion in the picture) breathtaking sunset, but on the inside it was said to be a picture of our greatest achivement in engineering with one step out onto the glass. So if someone were to ask ""how cool is it to be on the over a 1000-foot-high glass bottomed walkway during the time of  demand when the sunset is particulary vibrant?"" You would probably say that it is pretty neat because there is a visible sunset, but in all actuality there is no rainbow in the sky at all it is instead not only a bland colorless face, but it is also raining.

Something that you cannot see in pictures is maybe what is going on in a persons head that can be affecting their emotional facial expression. Since you cannot see what is going on in their head then you might start making all of this up in your head to figure out where you want to take the story or what the characters feelings towards something are. Your interpretation of the picture might stand back and you might start thining more about what could be going on because this character is very important and is crucial to the story and in order to do that you would need to know their feelings, but what if this character is a villain and thier main thing is not to show how they're feeling?

In conclusion I do not believe that you can determine someones emotions from s stricty pictures stand point because it is impossible to determine all of that off of an image, it may be difficult to prove these emotions are wrong unless it is stated otherwise, but that isn't the point; the point is that we as humans are not built to determine emotions off of a picture we are built to determine these off of everyday actions and facial expressions.",1
"The Electoral College is a process put into place by the founding fathers for the purpose of electing a president. However, this process was enacted at the very beginning of the United States and the question must be asked, Is it still necessary? Or even fair? With advancing technology and better processes, the old ways of doing things must be questioned.

Almost all states have a winnertakeall system in place, with the exception of Maine and Nebraska. This system has many faults and in some cases can produce false results. A presidential candidate that wins by a large majority in a state will win the electoral votes of that state, however, if another candidate wins a very close election, heshe will also win a state. For example, in the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and President Bush, Al Gore won the popular vote of the people but lost the election for president because of the electoral college, the very fact that we know what the popular vote was is proof of neccesity of change. Not only this, but sixty percent of voters want to vote directly. This makes it possible for a candidate to have more individual votes but less electoral votes, making the system somewhat corrupt.

Not only is the process of the Electoral College unfair, it is simply not necessary, with most voters using digital machines to enter their vote for candidate, votes can be counted digitally and accurately. The electoral college was a great idea before computers were invented and all votes had to be counted by hand. When the process of the Electoral College was put into place, it would have been impossible to count he votes of the entire country with any degree of accuracy, and even if it was possible, the validity of votes would be constantly be questioned. But in this day and age technology makes the very idea of the electoral college obsolete. I understand the desire for preserving traditional methods but not when it sacrifices a fast, fair, easy system.

Not only should we use a system using computers to count votes, but we already do, news broadcasters show which presidential candidate is winning in real time using modern technology. This allows us to know which candidate has won the election on voting day. Keep in mind that when the electoral college was made, many citizens had no idea who had won often until the next year. The fact that we know immediately is proof that the meeting of the Electoral college in December is completely unnessessary. And what if there is a tie in the electoral vote, although we know what the popular vote is, we would still have to send the vote to congress.

Times have changed. Technology has improved. With this the very building blocks of our government must be improved and updated.",0
"An anti-lock brake sytem inneffiecent if they were never used ever again and had uncontrolled accidents no one would care to tey would use them without even paying attention to what they dont have.and the reason for that is slowing down the car just a slight bit might help precvent an accident. Did you know that when you slam on the brake your tiries loose traction with the road and make you skid and if you thought about it when you lose traction you lose control of your car, yes you can recover from a skid but only if tou know what your doing so if you dont know what your doing or if you cant drive then why would you want someone to have an anti-lock braked systom.

Then Not have control of the car and you slamed on the brakes at let say 80 miles a hour or maybe you were trynna show off to some friends and your tire popped when you tried to stop at 80 miles a hourlater on tou lose control of the car when a tire pop because your not always going to have tire pressure montiors then if you were trying to stop ar get some form of control of the car and the tire popped you may usually practice safe driving and you may not like using yout tire why would you?

Well if you were in the moment it is worth to keep in mind that this car doesnt have no tire pressure moniors even though we are technology reliant so the future cars might even be elctical without any frame so that means no gas or not typical cars made out of metal and wteel but no improvements have been made so if you were to ahve anaphobic teens or a teenager that is really defines on be safe not being able to stop the car would you learn from your past and not buy a car or would you instead choose to buy since new car which everyone would be better than the last no matter how much safety the inventor addedso think about.

In my opinion it isnt worth it because yeah being able to control the car is great and a must have but if you stop to pay attention to your driving ability takes a lot of focus to stop a car so you dont think about the next thing you would like to argue about cars but istead take some time to think think about what you cant see everday because of your decision think about what has value and that is not the safet in a car think about is the reason why you are alive right now is it because of car safety or is it because of good luck.",1
"A car free world?! That sounds splended! Over seventy percent of Vauban's families in Germany do not own cars, and almost fifty-seven percent sold their car to move there due to the fact that they are almost ninety percent car free. There are so many advantages on limiting your car usage.

Think of it like this, you walk outside your front door and see hundreds of big bulky cars and trucks flying by giving off greenhouse gas emissions from their tailpipes, which is not good for you at all. Is that what you want to see every morning? Or do you want to swing up that front door, smell those roses, and see all your neighbors hopping on their bikes about to ride off to work.

There are so many benefits of limiting car usage but a main one is the health of the people. How many times a day do you see an overweight person struggling to get in or out of their car? Here in America it has become a casual sight. Now picture this, you see that same person getting on a bike and driving to and from work. How long do you think it is going to take until they start to loose weight and start to feel healthier, inside and out.

Some ignorant people say that the car industry is boosting, but I agree with those intelligent people who are seeing that the industry has been slowly declining. You see more people taking taxis, carpooling, or texting their friends to pick them up. ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift."" -Mimi Sheller, an extremely smart professor at Drexel University. She is refering to the decline in car buying and the amount of people getting their licenses. Did you know that their has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 40 year olds getting a license, while the older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age. According to a study found last year, young people driving has decreased twenty-three percent between two-thousand one and two-thousand nine.

Do the smart thing, get a bike and ditch the gas guzzling, greenhouse gas emissioning, car of yours today!",0
"The CAR would be much faster if it had been optimized for automotive use. Stated in document A, it says ""The reason the car looks different-is because it i designed to be lightweight wind-powered vehicle (emphasis added)."". Since the car was only designed to have a very light structure, be efficient, and to be wind-powered, it would be much easier to derief or even-destroy with one wrong move. In document C, it tells us that the car would have crushstructual which would take weeks even months to repair, and the driver would most likely die. Since the safety of the human driver is car's safety too, we would have to slow down the CAR tremendously to ensure the drivers safety. Onically, a faster way to build and prepare for the future is to to slow down the CAR, or the ""Common Automotive Reigon."".

Even though the CAR is an efficient way to travel and does not generate pollution, it was never a priority for this project. Our goal was to ""design a global research campaign to capture, archrive, and share the surface of Mars-and to test new technologie that may streneh future human expedition needs (quote from the Objective section)."". We have managed to complete that goal as of late because our vehicles and all of the equipment we use is only transporting without displaying the uses of what we have built. Because the point of this project was not to have fast transportation.

A human named Tate R. decided to put himself in the shoes of experiencing what driving in Mars would be like. We are currently in america, and he started the drive in Los Angeles in the Mojave Desert, California, and here are the words he wrote: ""The truth is:we are on our way to recreating the smooth, life-is-tweet scheduling of an freeway commute, Earth to car, minus the exits and billboards, five mundane work days zipping past at Martian velocity."". It explains that the purpose of not stopping by any means and speeding has been cumplished, but that is not the purpose of this project.",1
"Limiting car usage is a very good idea. With limiting car ussage there are many advantages such as no pollution, decreasing stress and excercise.

First of all, with not much car use you wont have pollution. There won't be any sickness from air pollution. If there arent as many cars then pollution will decrease. According to ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, Paris stopped car usuage due to record high amount of pollution. With this policy it decreased congestion by 60%.

Secondly, with limiting car usage means decreasing the amount of traffic. I know that everyone gets stressed by the amount of traffic there is on roads. I hear everyone talking about it. According to ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota."" by Andrew Selsky, decreasing the car usage increases improvements in the community such as new sidewalks, and a big change in traffic times for the better of course.

Lastly, excercise is very important and could be a major reason why we also stop usign cars. In a car you dont get to enjoy outside or even relax. With a car there is a higher percentage for a crash and most crashes are deadly. But if you start walking to school or work or church, you can get your excercise and also get some fresh air which includes Vitamin D. According to Mr. Sivak in ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, he says that his kids ""can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends."" Just by giving up a car does not mean that you have to give up having fun.

In conclusion, a decrease in car usage would be a very good thing. We could all get more excercise, decrease pollution, and decreasing stress. What's better than decreasing more stress than you already have? Nothing!",0
"The concept of the facial feedback theory is the conclusion of emotional theories having to do with effects of a mere smile. By smiling, the human brain communicates emotions to the person, rather than a mirror. An example of this concept would be if everyone on Earth died out, the next civilization to find the Sphinx would see it as a giant building of sadness due to the frown, even though we interpret it as a great piece of art. For thousands of years, emotional theories have been developed over descriptions of the most complicated thing on this planet: the human body. Charles Darwin even proposed a theory, much debated, that facial expressions evolved from animals. Today, one of every job and something we use to communicate with people far away depends on the expressions of humans: software.

Sophomore Pedro Domingos and his team of computer engineers at the University of Washington have come up with a software that recognizes hidden emotions. This software reads ninety percent of the human emotions by how much they smile, and even how much they squint their eyes. Mr. Domingos himself blushes and tapes his face to teach a Physics class a lesson on emotion recognition. Body language becomes a thing of the past and so do lies since this software becomes a regular household piece of electronic. Humans even start to have trouble interpreting emotion correctly because the human interaction has become a thing of the past. Today, bread has more emotions than people, and it all traces back to a single idea by Darwin.

The downfall of Emotional Era hasn't encountered much problem except for a slight misinterpretation. Although the idea is creative and unique, the time and effort put into spreading this fad could have been saved and used elsewhere. Brian Merchant uses ""Dodge's marketing machine"" to promote the newest Care application that ""doesn't just tell you what your friends are feeling. It catalogs and charts your mutual mood data...then uses it to predicts future mood valleys"" in a way that not only helps you, but benefits Dodge. Care began because ""people were looking down and typing on their devices -- even if someone they loved was nearb"". Although the younger generation may find this new concept exiting and unique, the emotional theory of the modern generation is solely the time spent thinking of new article ideas and coming up with Care updates without even considering the true emotions behind all that handy technology.

Human emotion is a beautiful concept that has been the inspiration of thousands of movies, paintings, sculptures, and even technological revolution. The way our timy facial muscles twitch and turn into millions of expressions throughout a lifetime can change the life of ourselves and others. Even though the concept of emotions and ideas of the past century has been carried on beyond the stratosphere, do not forget the unique beauty that lies behind every eye and beneath each smile that belongs to humanity and its billions of emotions.",1
"Dear Mr. Senate, I believe that we should change the Electoral College to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I think we should change it because it's unfair to voters, you can't trust that the electors will vote for who you want to vote for, and then there is the disaster factor'.

First off, the Electoral College is unfair to voters. As Bradford Plumer pointed out in the article, The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,""The electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states.""So basically what he is saying is that if one state already has a lead and the candidate has no chance of winning he isn't going to focus on them. The candidate is only going to focus on the states where he has a chance of swinging the vote towards himhence the term swing states.For example during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all.

Second of all, you cant trust that the electors that you vote for are going to vote for the president you want. For example, what if you want to vote for Obama and so you vote for the elector that says he will vote for Obama, but then when its time to vote the elector changes his mind and she votes for rodney instead. Now what? You put your trust in one person and she didnt vote for who you wanted. Now you might have to wait another four years to have a chance of getting a different president.

Last but not least, one of the single best arguments against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor'. In the article, The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,it states,""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" The oppsong claim states that we should keep the electoral college. Some reasons stated in the article, In Defense of the Electoral COllege: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,are,""A dispute over the outcome of an ELectoral College vote is possibleit happened in 2000 but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The Electoral Colllege requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. The winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidatesas we saw in 2012's election to focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states. The elctoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. The electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.",0
"The racial caste system is an important system to stop people from having emotion or racial equality. ""War on Drugs"" is one of the main things to keep the racial caste system in place, because the cops arrest more colored people then whites. The police does not arrest all colored people, but arrest a high number of them. Another reason to keep the racial caste system in place is because of deporting imigrants. In the article ""The Racial Caste System"" the author stated, ""We have developed a massive system of imprisonment, unlike any other country on the planet: in teh past two decade we have imprisoned more than ten million people. The World. On page.

Even though the Europe can learn a little from some things America is the opposite becasue all the people in power want to keep the system in place. With Barack Obama deporting almost 2 million immigrants it shows us he wants to keep the system in place. It is not only him wanting to keep the system in place, but a majority of Americans.  ""Public opinion surveys on prison and the criminal justice system were largely unchanged by the recession and remain where they were in 2000 - three quartersl of those surveyed say that crime is a ""very serious"" or ""fairy serious"" problem."" The United States does not only focus on arresting people, but has ""the more than 60,000"" people in solitary confinement both each one has their own cell. The United States has the racial caste system in place becasue enough people using solitary confinement focused only on the imprisonment.

Since the United States has the racial caste system in place because of the imprisonment, how do we not realize that all the problem we are faceing with crimes is because we have the system in place? There is no way to lower or prevent the crime rate from keepin gup because we have the system in place. We started off lower class area to be ""run down"" becasue nobody would want to be part of it, but it only took ""twenty-five years"" for the stereoty[es to be broken enought with ""some of the trendiest restaurants in Manhattan"" are located.",1
"The face that was discovered was not created by aliens. It was actually a natural landform. This was also proven by research and people taking pictures with high powered and accurate cameras.

NASA descoverd that the face wasn't actaully a real face. It was a land form it was proven that it was a huge rock formation that resembles a human head. Also it was formed by shadows which made an illusion of the face to have eyes, a mouth, and a nose like a human does.

Also Michael Malin and his very powerful camera took pictures of the face. He discovered that it was really a landform and it wasn't created by aliens. But poeple didnt believe that it actually was a land form because it was very cloudy near the planet mars. So Malin and his team, took another picture they discovered that the landforms were actaully common to a landform in America.

However, the face triggered a lot of attention. The face became very popular in America. The face appeared in movies, book, magazines, and also on radio shows. People started to think that the theoy was true because it was featured in things that people see or watch everyday.

In conclusion, The face was proven to be a landform after all. NASA discoverd that it was a rock formation, also Michael Malin and his team saw that it was a landform by conducting a study twice.",0
"The adjective retrieves is the defining word for paragraph two, describing how the thoughts are called back. Of four possible meanings of comprehend in this conteaxt , paragraph four get the point; dogs comprehend scent far better than humans do because they perceive it more directly. Although the vast majority of the human brain is devoted to sight, our least acute sense, the two poorest human senset sight and smell are actually related, operating on the same principle: the more receptors, or sniffers, the better. Smell is the archaic sense; over millenia, our ancestors' survival depended on sniffing out the enemy, prey, or wild berries that could be found in dense underbrush. As we learned to walk upright, towering over others, our noses sank ever closer to the ground, and our visual aperatus increadingly overshadowed our sense of smell.

Scientists now believe that one reason dogs can sniff out cancer is that they can smell the volatile organic compounds exuded by malignant tumors. Dogs can recognize the smell of a number of illegal drugs even when the drugs have been diluted to concentrations as low as a few parts per billion in aair. Authorities in New Zealand have enlisted a folding sniffer dog named Pesto to combat smuggling of avocados and other produce; he can detect fruit scent on people or in luggage that is not visibly contaminated. Burglars sometimes advise clients to have canine units check their houses before installing electronic security systems, in hopes that even if the dogs miss the scent of the humans, they will scare off robbers by their mere presence. A hominid struggling to survive in dense foliage or to stalk prey cannot unbutton and remove his Smell-o-Vision nose. When considering the next human sensory apparatus, designers of forthcoming virtual-reality devices are unlikely to add sniffing to the array of seeing, hearing, and sometimes touching, plus taste for the most advanced devices.

The central idea is how humans and canines compare in retriving scent, and uses dogs enhancing of scent to help support. Humans have the poorest sense of smell then any other animale that retrive scent. Obviously, that is not suprising when estimating the fact that humans rely on sight most of the time. Dogs, on the other hand. are the exact opposite and rely on scent the most. So when comparing between humans and canines, the sensory that should be compared the most is retriving scent.

In the sankara debate we learn that scent changes slower than what humans percieve. Because humans eyesight is not very sharp, our sense telines with our eyesight. When we are blind to something we sometimes need the scent to guide us, so not only does it help to see ares more clearly it as well lets us agnowledge if were somewhere near it's location because during the distance we can pick up it's scent. Our sense of smell has such a deep connection to our survival.",1
"Phones & driving

Why shouldn't there be any phones while driving there could causes different things to happen.

Cell phones while diving has been a big problem in different type of forms . There would always be accounts because people would drive while on the phone and that's how you get in big accounts there would always be a account once a day people would be on the phone . And people that drive while on the phone they would talk on the phone or play a game while driving or texting while driving and that should not be done because of all that can happen in a minute or less that's how you can get in accident . But naw police if they see you doing all that they can give you a ticket if you are on the phone while driving. Bring able to pay better attention , being less likely to have a crash , following the law so there wouldn't be anything happening to other people so you have to be carful of you and your places around you at all times because you don't want anything bad happing around you ."" Each day, 11 teens die in crashes caused by texting and driving . 2.35 million people in the US are injured or disabled by car crashes every year. More than 330,000 of these crashes that cause severe injury are caused by texting and driving .''

We should have not have people on the phone while driving . Because we don't want big and bad things happening to people when they don't need it we want everyone to be okay . We want everyone to drive safe and phone & driving or not a good thing to be doing we want to get away from that we should not Allow that to happen no more texting or on the phone while driving. You can only us your phone when you are finally parked somewhere. But just always be concerned of your surroundings . Because we would not want anything bad happening to nobody around us we want everyone safe . And phones/driving is a United States law because it's not allowed to phones and drive and if they see you like the police they would Give you a ticket. But always more remember to not text and drive .

But always remember that you should not be on the phone while driving because that's is not safe for you and the people around you . But also this should stop because it has been happening a lot .",0
"If you take time to think about what you have seen in a day, the people that you interact with, or have offered you service, are you lkely to analyze their emotions, or how they are feeling, based on their looks, statements, or the tone of their voice? Maybe, because people analyze others' emotions everyday, and most people are obsrervant. Many people have been told that beauty is not what is on the outside, it is what is on the insiode. Therefore, automotive manufacturers can argue that the technology they are creating for cars are to improve the car, and to help the car with it's abilities, not to focus more on the driver's and passenger's beauty.

Before reading the 3D-LiDAR sensor was going to be used for a car, which was unlikely, I thought that it was the car of the future, which is hoping would not be all about the looks, or the car of the present, which was aware that most people were about the looks. When I saw that Todd Neff wrote that the Volkswagen called it ""a smart car that stands apart from rivals - the first crisp packet car"" and ""could be smarter, not louder, lower, cooler, happier, whatever."", this showed that the new phone was not for the looks of it, it was for the technology dumb people, or even people that care more about technology than look, to access how good the technology of the car was. So, I took two minutes to sit and stare at the whole short essay prompt again, and I thought it over. Even though it is true that the LiDAR sensor is the car of the future, was it build just because of that reason, did we not take another thing into consideration, like that it was ""just another feature for the automotive industry to add on to the future car?"", or did we take many good, or an obvious reason to purchase it, into consideration, and purchase it because you were impressed with the car?

My answer of whether I would think it was a good idea, in my opinion, is no, I would not think it was a good idea to buy the car. Even though the car looks like a ""passenger airplane"" or ""a spaceship with no windows"", it is just another car, minus the fact that it will have flying abilities. Now, the technology help some increase their creativity to create the unbuilt ""typing class"", but that is a mini techonology workshop, or a mobile technology workshop. Ain't no class going to be held back there, it is simply to show off what the car can do. People are already stressing so much about how they look, or how they are going to look, that taking that feature into consideration pointless. Although cars are nice to have, are they necessary? No, they are not. So buying a car simply because you like it, but it is not practical or not a good idea for whatever reason, is not a problem. You do not need to buy a car because you like it, or because luxury cars are your style, or because of the gimmicks on it.",1
"The message coming from these four passages is that with the amount of driving it's causing what some say ""smog"". The ""smog"" is caused by the amount of cars, all the exhaust is bad for the air. In the first passage, second paragraph it states that some people gave up there cars. There's not a lot of driving and there's only two places to park, a large parking garage at the end of the development and if someone buys a space for $40,000 which comes with a home.

In the second passage ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" they enforce a small ban on driving to clear the air of the city. During the couple of day that this occured 4,000 people were fined for $31 for not leaving there cars at home, along with the 27 people who had their car impounded for their reaction to the fine. After five days of no cars, the smog in the air had decreased. After about a week the smog had cleared enough for them to clear the ban.

In the third passage ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" it says they went three years with only taking buses or taxis for the Day Without Cars in a city of 7 million. If people drove cars they were fined just like the people were in Paris, only in Bogota it was a $25 fine. Some people in the city of Bogota state ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". New places have been built, old things were made new in this city, it seems to be a better place there.

In the last passage ""The End of Car Culture"" It talks about the driving and the cars in the US. Studies show that Americans are buying fewer and fewer cars, less driving, and less people are getting their licenses as the years pass by. Since 2005 the number of miles has been dropping year after year. many sociologists believe that if this type of pattern continues it will have benefits for the carbon emissions and for the enviorment around us.

As you see there are many differnt things going on around the globe that have to do with the amount of driving and how it's not entirely good for Earth. In some cities the amount of smog has decreased, some cities have become better with new buildings and things that were rebuilt. In one of the cities people enjoy the ""Car-free days"" it relieves stress in people and helps clean the air of their enviorment. There are many different ways that limiting car usage is an advantage to us. Less stress, cleaner air, and a better enviorment.",0
