"The usage of cars around the whole world has been the main reason why the earth is facing with air pollution problems and day by day our ozone layer is breaking. To solve this problem we can limit the usage of cars or any type of moving vehicle that can harm us and use other efficient ways to get to places.

There have been places in this world where they have started to move to make a difference in the earth. For example in source one ""Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free"" except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs..."" in Vauban, Germany there are alot of suburban communities who have giving up using cars or have sold their cars to make their houses where they live. Not only have they be making car free streets but also have taken out parking spaces so that people can reduce the usage of cars. This change can be either economicaly better for everyone but can also be useful for people to start thinking to go outside more. In Bogota, Colombia they have created a program that is set to spread to all the Colombians to hike, bike, skate and also take the bus to their jobs, it is a car-free day like stated in this statement from source 3 ""It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines."" This improvement campaign began in the mid-1990s.

In other countires like in source two ""after days or near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial ban to clear the air of the global city"" this was due to the large amount of smog that cars give out to the layers of air. The citizens of Paris would also have to pay a fine. Source two also states that ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitlas... [last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particular matter (PM) per cubic mater compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" this is the reason why Paris has started to make a change. They are many other solutions to changing the cars we us today to others like electrical cars where you only have to charge them and you can use them it would not harm our ecosystem in any way. Driving a car not only affects our earth but can be very stressful for the driver because he or she would have to face in their every day life traffic jams, but looking for other ways to get to your destination would separate you from having to go through that everyday.

One of the biggest produces of this problem is the United States of the America where all of the cars we know have been created and is also one the most more advanced countries. In source four is states that ""President Obamas's ambitious goals to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled las week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suugest that Americans are buying fewer cars, drivinf less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" as hard as this sounds if we dont get to moving we will soon die little by little. We also lower down the percentage of car accidents if we reduce the usage of cars, the level of mortality would not decrease so fast.

In conclusion, you have learned that driving a car is very harmful for the planet and if we dont start making a change our earth would be more polluted then how it is now. Start making a change and think smart.",0
"Having a car is a pain, you have to worry about every littile thing. Cars are not good for the environment, the pollution from the cars is destorying everything. That is why people are limiting their usage of the cars. I am going to tell the advantages of limiting your car usage.

In paris they banned people from driving their cars because of the smog. They enforced this ban to clear the air of the global city. They alos said if anyone is driving they would have to pay a fin of 22-euro which is 31 dollors. The smog cleared enough on monday for the ruling french party to rescind the ban.

Since some people have stopped driving thie cars construction on bike paths. People in colombia have huiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. This has help prevent trafic lams, and brough down pollution. This is to help promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.

In bogot the rain hasn't stoped people from limiting their car usage. Limiting car usage is a great opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. For the frist time two more colombian cities cali and valledupar joined the event. They are starting a revolutionary change and is crossing borders.

The limiting of car usage is helping the pollution problem alot. People are also going on hikes, bike rides, skating to work to help. The day without cars is improvement campaign that began in the mid-1990s. The car limiting usage is a really good thing that we are doing. This is just what  we need to help get rid of pollution in the world and keep it save.",0
"Limiting car usage is a good idea. Limiting cars usage it a wonderful idea for many reasons. most people have the ability to live there life without cars, this would help cut back on pollution, and for most people it would be cheaper. Although some people may see this as a impossible way of living some of us do not.

To begin, people can live without cars people have done it before us and eventually people will do it after us. As shown in source 1 these people in Vauban, Germany have given up a life of cars for a simpler much quiter life in the suburbs. Life in this city has been condensed down into a one square mile area where people are able to go on with there everyday lives without having to get into a car to go somewhere. Life in this city is does not go completely without cars if these people need to leave the city they can simply walk to their very own parking space in the parking garage right on the outskirts of the city. these people have the ability to keep there cars but they have to buy a parking space when they buy there house you also generally wouldnt need your car unless you were going on a long drive that required you to leave the city. There is also the fact that there will be a day soon when we run out of fossil fuels and what is a fossil fuel? gas. there will soon enough be a day where we dont have any gas and we will not be able to drive cars everywhere that we want.

Next, this would be one of the most effective ways to cut back on pollution. as shown in the 2nd source paris was struggling with a very bad pollution problem that they needed to deal with. Paris was having the same sort of problem that beijing, china is having and beijing is the most poluted city in the world. so they banned all the cars that ended in a even number on monday and a odd number on tuesday. Just doing this for one day cut the amount of pollution in half. Imagine our worldwide pollution levels if driving was limited. The second largest form of pollution is cars so limiting driving could even drop cars a few ranks back. Every part of getting to fossil fuels that fuel our cars is more and more pollution. gas is a very large pollutants and it causes lot of problems for our nation and one day there will be no more gas.

Furthermore, limiting driving would almost be cheaper for the people as talked about in source 4 less and less people have been getting there licenses and driving cars because it isnt needed as much anymore. there are more ways of public transit that people are taking advantage of such as the mans son who takes the Bay Area Rapid Transit instead of driving his car. some might say that taking these other forms of transportation might take longer and yes they might be right but they are also much cheeper instead of having to pay a large amount of money to first, buy a car and then, buy gas. which the gas prices only seem to be going up lately. They have the ability to buy cheep tickets for the ride on the train or maybe a bus. As i spoke about earlier we will one day run out of fossil fuels. Gas is a fossil fuel and leading up to the time where we wont have gas anymore the gas will just keep getting more and more expensive because the less gas we have in our community the more that it will cost. also the more that people will want it one day most of us will not have the money to drive cars not because of the cost of the car but because of the cost of the gas.

Coming to a end, there are many other ways to travel other than buy a vehichle and some may be easier for you cheeper for you or better for the environment so why keep on hurting the environment when you could simply make the world a better place by just not driving a car. there are many reasons to limit driving but we could easily do it because people can live without cars, it would help the environment and cut back on pollution, it would also be much cheeper.",0
"Texting and Driving

Ten percent of injury crashes in 2011 were reported as being distraction-affected crashes. ""In 2011, 3,331 people were killed in crashes involving a distracted driver, while in comparison to 3,267 in 2010"". An additional 387,000 people were injured in motor vehicle crashes that involved a distracted driver, as opposed to 416,000 injuries in 2010. Texting and driving is not worth the risk of killing or injuring anyone.

Texting and driving is the most preventable type of car accident worldwide. If everyone will just put their phone up when they drive, they could prevent one more car crash. Another way to prevent texting and driving is to purchase then apply a drive cam, which records a driver's activity while in the car. Another way is to get the AT&T app called AT&T drive mode that disables the person's phone while driving so they're unable to text and drive. Most if not all texting and driving accidents can be prevented before they happen.

If your phone doesn't have any storage you can go to the AT&T website, itcanwait. com, and take the pledge not to text and drive. Itcanwait. com is one of many websites that gives facts and statistics to try to prove to teenagers around the world to put their phone down while driving. No text is worth someone else's life. Not only does this one mistake destroy the life that was taken caused by the mistake it destroys the life of that person's family.",0
"PHONES & DRIVING

Technology has extremely increased in today's generation. Many people have a tendency to rely on their devices while driving. Phones are very addictive to have. People surely can't get their eyes off the devices for more than at least a minute. They will look at the phone while doing everything. The main problem that is occurring is that people are texting while driving an automobile. Should or shouldn't drivers be able to use their cellphones while operating a vehicle.

I believe drivers shouldn't be able to use their cellphones while driving unless for navigation. It's extremely dangerous to look of the road to send one simple text messages. For example, if you are driving at 55mph while texting or looking at your phone; within them seconds you could have easily got into a car accident with major injuries. This reason is only one reason you shouldn't be able to use your cellphone while driving.

Another reason that you shouldn't be able to use your cellular device while driving is it puts your life at risk and put other innocent lives at risk. When you make the decision to text and drive, you make the decision to risk the lives of those around you and your life as well. That simple action of ""answering a quick text"" or even glancing at a text means that you are selfishly putting other people's lives in danger. It is one thing to put your own life in danger, but it is unfair and unnecessary to risk the lives of others. These innocent people; young children, friends in your car, pedestrians, and fellow drivers, did absolutely nothing wrong and are forced to have their lives at risk solely due to a poor decision that you made.

The last and final reason is that it's illegal. Regardless of the all the harm caused by texting and driving, it is also illegal in many states. Fines and punishments for texting and driving range greatly depending on the state that you live in; for some states, the fine is merely $20, however, in others, it can be up to $500. And, if the action of texting and driving ends in injuring any other individuals, you can actually end up in jail, depending on the severity of the injury. This right here is just the icing on the cake as to why you should stop texting and driving!

In conclusion, people shouldn't be able to operate a cellphone while driving, unless it for directions, a vehicle because it is very dangerous and also illegal. Taking your eyes off the road for one text can take a life. It's okay to want until your done driving to use your cellphones! So please keep your eyes on the road and don't pick up the phone.",0
"Venus has been proven to be a dangerous planet, yet scientist continue the attempt of research because it is believed to be a worthy cause, which is what the author believes in as well. Scientists have been trying to research and evaluate Venus for many years, however there are still many obstacles to be overcome. The author supports the idea that Venus is a worthy a pursuit despite the dangers it poses in a mediocre way. They could have gone about it in way which the idea was supported throughout the article, but instead the idea is not posed until the middle.

According to Paragraph 3 ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" These conditions are extremely dangerous for humans. The passage even states ""These conditions are more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" At first the author does poorly to support the idea that Venus is worthy pursuing because only the dangers, such as those above, are listed and supported with details.

As the article nears the end some solutions to the dangers are posed, enabling the author to support the idea that Venus is worth the pursuit. A possible solution to the ""hostile conditions"" would allow scientist to get close enough to observe Venus, however it would cause them to be unable to get any rock samples. Humans would have to stay at least 30 miles above the surface. The temperature would still be high at whopping 170 degrees Fahrenheit, however the air pressure would be close to that of Earth's and even survivable for humans. The author also states in Paragraph 5 that ""Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels."" This could also allow for the possibility of life on Venus. ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.""

The author should have supported the idea that Venus is worth pursuing throughout the article, rather than beginning to support it in the middle. The author wrote plenty of negative facts about Venus in the first few paragraphs, causing the reader to wonder about the safety of ""Earth's 'twin'"". In order make the main idea clear the author should have listed a few negative things, and then contradicted them with facts and supporting details. This would have made the article stronger, immaculately organized, and more understandable as well.",0
"Cars are a very useful means of transportation, but there are advantagess to limiting the usage of cars. The use of cars creates greenhouse gas emissions, creates smog, backs up traffic, and depletes our natural resources. Limiting the usage of cars can decrease all that, along with improving safety. There has already been places to have test a ""car-free"" environment, such as, Germany, Paris, and Colombia. All of which had positive results.

The use of cars may not seem it, but actually causes more of an inconvinence and takes up a lot of space that can be use for other things. If there were to be no cars, stores would be placed in walking distance. This is where cars are inconvienent. Because so many people own cars, stores don't build in walking distance, but instead in malls along distant highways. People can't just walk and get whatever it is they want, but instead wait forever in traffic jams to get to a store and then wait again to get back home. We also lose a lot of space because of cars. Lands that could be used to built for parks,  bycicle paths, ect., are instead used to make garages, or parking areas for cars.

One of the most worst things that is caused by the use of cars is air pollution. The emissions from tail pipes creates greenhouse gases. In fact, passenger cars are resposible for twelve percent of green house gas emissions in Europe, and up to fifty percent in some car-intensive areas in the United states. Another effect of using cars is smog. Paris had actually banned the use of cars at a point to lower the levels of smog, and diesel fule was blamed. People were fined for driving cars, and delivery companies complained of lost revenue, but the limited use of cars helped clear the smog.

There are ways to limit the use of cars, not just in means of driving less, but by the number of those who are driving. People can limit the use of cars by changing the type of transportation they use. For example, instead of driving everday, a person could take a public bus to get to where they need to go, or that person could car pool with others that they  know. A person could even organize the majority of what they do to where they rarely are need of a vehicle, and simply walk. There are many advantages to lowering the use of cars. It reduces greenhouse gases, lowers the level of smog, and it conserves our natural resources.",0
"In order to detect human emotions these students are saying thrie computer can do it. I dont believe this and i'll tell you why.

Computers can tell you how u fell on the outside but can't tell you about the inside. Emotions are not based on facial expressions. I can smile through pain but the computer won't tell you that. Many people cause decive you with there emotions. The person who created this only uses six basic emotions that can decive you on the outside.

Explaining human emotions are very difficult because you cant actually tell how they feel on the inside. The emotions the show on the outside could decive how you see things. You should take the time to ask the person how they really feel after you get the results to see how accurate the computer really is. This computer cause not actually help these researchers.

Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional coomunication. With this being said i do not believe any computer in the 21st century is advanced enough to read true human emotion. Maybe one day somebody will invent the greatest computer ever. But as of right now emotion truly can't be read unless the person themselves actually tells you.",0
"In the Article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" the most major advantage citizens can have on limiting car use is taking part in keeping our Ozone safe. By constantly driving humans are making pollutions on Earth. There are many different ways these pollutions can have an effect on citizens. One being direct rays from the sunlight beaming down on the Epidermis. Another, being clouds filling up with smoke and looking dis-colored.

By walking citizens have a bunch of advantages. Excercise is a must in certain cases . Cities are embracing the fact that we can stay healthy while limiting pollution. Germany has come up with a convienent solution: build everything that is needed by citizens within walking distance. People are moving to areas like this just to get away from driving. In other places like Paris, they are creating a ban on certain days. Once Paris' smog build-up began to rise they knew something had to be done. To slove this problem drivers were to stop driving until the smog was gone. Citizens were only allowed to drive if they carpooled. Public Transportation was free for the whole week.

In Bogota, they started on this project by creating 118 miles of bicycle paths. Other cities began to get so exited that they traveled to Bogata to see the wonders of this way. The bicycle lanes have made a huge improvement on rush-hour trafic. It is said that walking would relieve stress in many areas.

Walking has also effected the American communtiy. Less cars are being bought and so are less drivers licenses being obtained as the years go by. Researchers are asking if America has passed its urge for driving peak. People that dont drive will actually hurt companies. Multi-Million dollar companies like Ford and mercedes will start to loose funds due to this decision. America is all about mobility and if this starts to decrease then so will the profit of these places.",0
"Technology is important in most students every day lives. We use our cell phones or maybe even our computers all the time. Since we use technology so often, I think it is a good idea to produce technology that can understand us. That is why I believe that using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom would be very valuable.

In paragraph 6 of the article Dr. Huang predicted ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" If computers can recognize a students' emotions this may help that student learn in a new way that was never thought to be possible. For example, if a student is struggling with the same type of math problems and is receiving poor grades on a test, how will the teacher know how to help this student? If the computer senses confusion on these same types of math problems the students is answering incorrectly, a teacher could go back and look at these results and realize that the student is confused on these problems. This type of technology could help not just your average student but even students that struggle in school and need extra help.

Most people understand how to work technology like a computer, but can a computer understand us? Dr. Huang stated in the article that ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, so computers need to understand that, too."" It is important for our technology to understand us, that is what Dr. Huang is trying to achieve with the Facial Action Coding System. Technology that understands humans could greatly benefit the needs of students in a classroom. A computer could learn an individual student's learning style and accomodate according to that student's emotions. It could change the difficulty or easiness of certain tasks according to how a student feels about certain questions. That is why it is important for technology to understand how humans work and feel.

We as humans use technology all the time, wether that be at home, at work, or in the classroom. When it comes to students in a classroom, technology can be extremely helpful. That is why it is important to have technology that cannot only read human emotions, but help a struggling student or accomodate to a specific student's needs in the classroom.",0
