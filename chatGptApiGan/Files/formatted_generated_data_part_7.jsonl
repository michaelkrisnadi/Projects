Even after our many launches of aircrafts into the atmosphere, we know very little of what it truly out in the endless void of space. In the article, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests that studying Venus specifically is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author would be correct in this statement as we humans know very little about the planet because of numerous factors making it a difficult planet to study, but solving those problems would lead into advancement. Including that becuase the planet is closely related to earth, that could mean it supported life long ago. Lastly that striving to meet the challenge presented, despite the roadblocks, would lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.\n\nThe planet in space we call Venus has a reputation for how troubling it is to study because of numerous factors. As included in the article, Venus has \"A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets...clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid...planet's surface tempurature average of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit...Atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater...\" Venus is an extremely difficult planet to study which is why it would be such an amazing goal to study it fully. If NASA and the people of Earth fight to overpower these issues, we would advance as a species, developing more solutions to fight these problems. By facing the problems presented by Venus, we would finally be able to study it and even find out is there is, or was life on Venus.\n\nIn the article, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author stated that \"Astromoners are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\" Shortly after this, they also stated that \"Long ago, Venusm was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\" The search for life in space has been one outrageously demanded by the public and Venus may very well be the place to look, after we can penetrate the bounderies it has in store. It was even stated in the article that Venus even has features extremely similar to some found on Earth, furthering the support that Venus could have or does support life. Regardless if Venus supports life or not, if we as a species can get past the barriers of Venus, would lead us into many equaly intimidating endeavors that we can surpass.\n\nThe author sugests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and supports that when they say, \"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equaly intimidating endeavors.\" They also say in the next sentence \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\" By surpassing the challenge of Venus, we will have the technology an wisdom to surpass other difficult challenges we may encounter, overall gaining the knowledge and power to gain more knowledge and power.\n\nThe exploration of Venus is indeed a difficult and dangerous task, but in the end would be worth while. By advancing our technologies we can bypass the dangers of Venus and pave the road to move onto even more dangerous and difficult tasks, both on out planet and outside our planet. We could gain the knowledge of how similar Earth and Venus are, finalizing if it could have or did support life at one point in time. And the factors making Venus so dangerous, would be minimalized and surpassed."}]}

All you see is people from all ages staring at a device all day which is a phone. People are always stuck on their phones, that it seems they can never let it go while:working ,at school,cleaning,and driving. Some things caused by using your phone while driving are car accidents, irresponsible people driving, or you can get a fee.\n\nPhones can be such a distraction to everyone at anytime including while driving which is a safety hazard. A major cause of deaths in the US is motor vehicle accidents because of phone usage most of the time. \"About 33,700 people die in motor vehicle each year\" shown on CDC. This means that some of the accidents are from phone usage and other factors, but if people stop using their phones while driving their could be less accidents in the future. In the article \"Mobile phones and driving safety\", it stated that,\"In a 2011 study it was reported that over 90% of college students surveyed texts (initiate,reply,or read) while driving.\" It proves that even adults can be immature that they use their phones while driving even when knowing the possible consequences they may have. If people continue to use phones while driving then the rate of death will get higher and people would think that nothing will happen to them while using their phones.\n\nMany people may say that teens are the ones driving irresponsibly by using their phones when operating a vehicle. In reality, everyone from every age is irresponsibly driving. According to an article of \" Teen driver source\", \"In 2015, 42 percent of high school students who drove in the past 30 days reported sending a text or email while driving.\"The other half were most likely adults in which adults should set younger people an influence because they learn from them. In another passage on \"Science Daily' stated that, adults are always on their phone while driving with young kids either by sending a text, reading texts, on social media, or their just distracted driving. I believe that the adults should be more cautious including the teens but adults tend to have younger kids with them in the car.\n\nBoth the adults and teens are guilty of driving on their phones, but they should learn sooner to avoid any type of tragedy.\n\nEach state in the US has their own laws to protect their people. Since some don't listen the people in charge of the state they've made laws for people who drive careless. About 43 states have prohibited drivers to text or even be on their phones (Facts & Statistics about texting and driving). Even though not all states have been prohibited of being on their phones, almost all of them have which is a good difference. In some states if the police stops you for the first time for texting and driving, you can get a fee depending where you live. For example, Georgia has a fee of $150, Florida has one of $30,and New Jersey has one of $400. The fee law is a good option because if they stop you a second time then you could have jail time if you didn't learn the first time from the fee. If the US keeps making stricter laws of being on the phone while driving then the people will learn.\n\nIn conclusion, driving while using your phone at any age isn't right. By one simple distraction something tragic could occur. It's not always teens driving reckless, but if anyone act young by not responsibly driving then they could get a fee they have to pay. Driving while using the phone should be taken more serious to prevent any issues."}]}

In other words, many states are car free states and this has changed many cultural changes in the sociey that the people live in. Not using any cars provides many beneficial factors to not only the enviroment but to the people too and here's why. Having car-free states reduces car emission and can\u00a0provide\u00a0healthier productive lives of exercise.\u00a0This change\u00a0to the world can inspire lots of people and open up the doors of nature's beauty to provide a peaceful way of living to the enviroment of the world.\n\nWe use cars everyday in our lives from going to resteraunts, jobs, homes, schools,ect. However, do we ever think that whenever we drive we are causing more pollution to spread from every mile we go? Cars are the number one leading pollution emission enviroment destroyers in the world. This pollution causes many close suburban areas with homes around to breathe in gas emission from cars. This is absolutely not healthy at all to many people. For example, in the article written by Robert Duffer in his title, \"Paris bans driving due to smog.\" States that, \"[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particular matter (PM) per cubic meter...\" That is more toxin to inhale that could possibly kill you! There are countries, for instance, like Germany that have some cities \"car-free\" as an experimental way to stop pollution emission and traffic jams causing loud noises to some close\u00a0spaced suburban areas. Now, instead of using cars the people living in Germany are walking, riding bikes, or using trams to get from one place to another. So far, the people do not mind having any cars around and they even say they are happy and like the new change on where they live. \"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,\" says Heidrun Walter from the article by Elisabeth Rosenthal titled, \"Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.\" So whenever you first sit in a car think about what you are about to do and think about how you can benefit yourself and the world by not spreading pollution emission from cars.\n\nMany people want to exercise, stay fit, and lose weight depending on what they want to do. Some people like to jog or run to go to there jobs as a productive way to not use there cars but to get out and exercise more. Many people around the world perfer not to use cars but instead use any-other means of transportation to either make themselves healthy or to not use any means of spreading pollution. In fact many people that live in big cities such as New York and San Francisco with more cars driving in the population. Have young people from 16-39 year olds that don't have a drivers license use other means of transportation to benefit themselves. In the article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal titled, \"The End of Car Culture.\" States that, \"They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.\" People ages from 16-39 year olds are not caring about using cars or getting a drivers license but using any other means of transportation even if it is longer way to get to a destination. This is very beneficial for young people of 16-39 year olds to have healthy lives at a young age so they can live longer and they can feel good about themselves.\n\nCan you see now why having no cars as the means of transportation is a good thing? Many people are having healthier lives and live on not using pollution but using other means of transportation. People in many states and countries are happy with this change for the better as new meaning of change in cultural experiences. Now, are you able to change just like the people living the \"car-free\" life around the world?"}]}

However, this process was enacted at the very beginning of the United States and the question must be asked, Is it still necessary? Or even fair? With advancing technology and better processes, the old ways of doing things must be questioned.\n\nAlmost all states have a winnertakeall system in place, with the exception of Maine and Nebraska. This system has many faults and in some cases can produce false results. A presidential candidate that wins by a large majority in a state will win the electoral votes of that state, however, if another candidate wins a very close election, heshe will also win a state. For example, in the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and President Bush, Al Gore won the popular vote of the people but lost the election for president because of the electoral college, the very fact that we know what the popular vote was is proof of neccesity of change. Not only this, but sixty percent of voters want to vote directly. This makes it possible for a candidate to have more individual votes but less electoral votes, making the system somewhat corrupt.\n\nNot only is the process of the Electoral College unfair, it is simply not necessary, with most voters using digital machines to enter their vote for candidate, votes can be counted digitally and accurately. The electoral college was a great idea before computers were invented and all votes had to be counted by hand. When the process of the Electoral College was put into place, it would have been impossible to count he votes of the entire country with any degree of accuracy, and even if it was possible, the validity of votes would be constantly be questioned. But in this day and age technology makes the very idea of the electoral college obsolete. I understand the desire for preserving traditional methods but not when it sacrifices a fast, fair, easy system.\n\nNot only should we use a system using computers to count votes, but we already do, news broadcasters show which presidential candidate is winning in real time using modern technology. This allows us to know which candidate has won the election on voting day. Keep in mind that when the electoral college was made, many citizens had no idea who had won often until the next year. The fact that we know immediately is proof that the meeting of the Electoral college in December is completely unnessessary. And what if there is a tie in the electoral vote, although we know what the popular vote is, we would still have to send the vote to congress.\n\nTimes have changed. Technology has improved. With this the very building blocks of our government must be improved and updated."}]}

That sounds\u00a0splended! Over seventy percent of Vauban's families in Germany do not own cars, and almost fifty-seven percent sold their car to move there due to the fact that they are almost ninety percent car free. There are so many advantages on limiting your car usage.\n\nThink of it like this, you walk outside your front door and see hundreds of big bulky cars and trucks flying by giving off greenhouse gas emissions from their tailpipes, which is not good for you at all. Is that what you want to see every morning? Or do you want to swing up that front door, smell those roses, and see all your neighbors hopping on their bikes about to ride off to work.\n\nThere are so many benefits of limiting car usage but a main one is the health of the people. How many times a day do you see an overweight person struggling to get in or out of their car? Here in America it has become a casual sight. Now picture this, you see that same person getting on a bike and driving to and from work. How long do you think it is going to take until they start to loose weight and start to feel healthier, inside and out.\n\nSome ignorant people say that the car industry is boosting, but I agree with those intelligent people who are seeing that the industry has been slowly declining. You see more people taking taxis, carpooling, or texting their friends to pick them up. \"Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift.\" -Mimi Sheller, an extremely smart professor at Drexel University. She is refering to the decline in car buying and the amount of people getting their licenses. Did you know that their has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 40 year olds getting a license, while the older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age. According to a study found last year, young people driving has decreased twenty-three percent between two-thousand one and two-thousand nine.\n\nDo the smart thing, get a bike and ditch the gas guzzling, greenhouse gas emissioning, car of yours today!"}]}

With limiting car ussage there are many advantages such as no pollution, decreasing stress and excercise.\n\nFirst of all, with not much car use you wont have pollution. There won't be any sickness from air pollution. If there arent as many cars then pollution will decrease. According to \"Paris bans driving due to smog\" by Robert Duffer, Paris stopped car usuage due to record high amount of pollution. With this policy it decreased congestion by 60%.\n\nSecondly, with limiting car usage means decreasing the amount of traffic. I know that everyone gets stressed by the amount of traffic there is on roads. I hear everyone talking about it. According to \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota.\" by Andrew Selsky, decreasing the car usage increases improvements in the community such as new sidewalks, and a big change in traffic times for the better of course.\n\nLastly, excercise is very important and could be a major reason why we also stop usign cars. In a car you dont get to enjoy outside or even relax. With a car there is a higher percentage for a crash and most crashes are deadly. But if you start walking to school or work or church, you can get your excercise and also get some fresh air which includes Vitamin D. According to Mr. Sivak in \"The End of Car Culture\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, he says that his kids \"can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends.\" Just by giving up a car does not mean that you have to give up having fun.\n\nIn conclusion, a decrease in car usage would be a very good thing. We could all get more excercise, decrease pollution, and decreasing stress. What's better than decreasing more stress than you already have? Nothing!"}]}

I think we should change it because it's unfair to voters, you can't trust that the electors will vote for who you want to vote for, and then there is the disaster factor'.\n\nFirst off, the Electoral College is unfair to voters. As Bradford Plumer pointed out in the article, The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,\"The electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states.\"So basically what he is saying is that if one state already has a lead and the candidate has no chance of winning he isn't going to focus on them. The candidate is only going to focus on the states where he has a chance of swinging the vote towards himhence the term swing states.For example during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all.\n\nSecond of all, you cant trust that the electors that you vote for are going to vote for the president you want. For example, what if you want to vote for Obama and so you vote for the elector that says he will vote for Obama, but then when its time to vote the elector changes his mind and she votes for rodney instead. Now what? You put your trust in one person and she didnt vote for who you wanted. Now you might have to wait another four years to have a chance of getting a different president.\n\nLast but not least, one of the single best arguments against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor'. In the article, The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,it states,\"Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.\" The oppsong claim states that we should keep the electoral college. Some reasons stated in the article, In Defense of the Electoral COllege: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,are,\"A dispute over the outcome of an ELectoral College vote is possibleit happened in 2000 but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The Electoral Colllege requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. The winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidatesas we saw in 2012's election to focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states. The elctoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. The electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."}]}

The \"smog\" is caused by the amount of cars, all the exhaust is bad for the air. In the first passage, second paragraph it states that some people gave up there cars. There's not a lot of driving and there's only two places to park, a large parking garage at the end of the development and if someone buys a space for $40,000 which comes with a home.\n\nIn the second passage \"Paris bans driving due to smog\" they enforce a small ban on driving to clear the air of the city. During the couple of day that this occured 4,000 people were fined for $31 for not leaving there cars at home, along with the 27 people who had their car impounded for their reaction to the fine. After five days of no cars, the smog in the air had decreased. After about a week the smog had cleared enough for them to clear the ban.\n\nIn the third passage \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\" it says they went three years with only taking buses or taxis for the Day Without Cars in a city of 7 million. If people drove cars they were fined just like the people were in Paris, only in Bogota it was a $25 fine. Some people in the city of Bogota state \"It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution\". New places have been built, old things were made new in this city, it seems to be a better place there.\n\nIn the last passage \"The End of Car Culture\" It talks about the driving and the cars in the US. Studies show that Americans are buying fewer and fewer cars, less driving, and less people are getting their licenses as the years pass by. Since 2005 the number of miles has been dropping year after year. many sociologists believe that if this type of pattern continues it will have benefits for the carbon emissions and for the enviorment around us.\n\nAs you see there are many differnt things going on around the globe that have to do with the amount of driving and how it's not entirely good for Earth. In some cities the amount of smog has decreased, some cities have become better with new buildings and things that were rebuilt. In one of the cities people enjoy the \"Car-free days\" it relieves stress in people and helps clean the air of their enviorment. There are many different ways that limiting car usage is an advantage to us. Less stress, cleaner air, and a better enviorment."}]}
