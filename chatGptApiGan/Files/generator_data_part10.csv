"Should drivers be able to use their phone while operating a vehicle?

The age of technology is upon humanity and is affecting the species far more than anyone has expected. With more modernized devices being released at such a fast pace, it is not likely that one human of five will not have one. Technology, especially the usage of smart phones, has become ultimately distracting to humans. Operating a vehicle, however, is not the time to be distracted. Any driver, no matter the experience or skill, should not be able to use a cellular device while operating a motor vehicle because it is hazardous to themselves and others, and it is a leading cause of death.

To begin with, the distraction of a cellular device is most dangerous to the driver. Not only are they putting their life on the line to send a text or view a snapchat, they are also putting their license up for suspension and possible jail time because it is an illegal activity. Any impairment of a driver is an illegal act and can be tried in the court of law.

These drivers willingly know the consequences when they pull out their phone. It is important that the driver adhere to the responsibility bestowed upon them for the safety of themselves and others. Any mistakes made while moving are solely the driver's fault. A text or a call cannot amount to the value of a life, and the act of texting while driving is just as dangerous as drinking and driving. In other words, it would be thought that driving while using a phone would be less of an issue. However, it is one of the number one causes of death.

Moreover, the management of a cellphone while driving is one of the main causes of death today. These on-going issues have led to ""1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving."" (The National Safety Council Texting and Driving Statistics - Distracted Driving).

Not only are these wrecks traumatic to everyone involved, they effect the loved ones of those who got injured or died.

With such high stats, humans have began working to fix this matter in question. Many modern cars have come out with Bluetooth in the radio system which assists the driver with using his or her phone without actually using their phone. Bluetooth allows drivers to play music, text, and call all with minimal work applied. This update in technology can be seen as a breakthrough in modern advancements; but, it also has its faults that come along with it.

While managing to make the Bluetooth setting work, drivers can also find themselves just as distracted. Losing focus for five seconds or more on the road increases the risk of accidents and injuries. Looking somewhere else other than the road is just another second that the driver is not looking at oncoming traffic or pedestrians.

To conclude, a driver should not be allowed to use a cellular device while managing or operating a moving vehicle due to the risk of harming themselves as well as others, and the fact that it is illegal today and everyday following. Being a hazard on the road makes a hazard for everywhere around it. In this period of time, humans are developing technology to prevent this topic from happening in the future; however, until fully preventable, it should not be permitted.",0
"Dear Mr. Senator, I have decided to express my opinion to you about the Electoral College process for electing the President of the United States. This process should be abolished as soon as possible for it is corrosive to the American peoples opinion. We should instead switch to a popular vote by eligible American citizens to decide presidency.

Now some fellows might argue that the Electoral College is favored by the people. When in fact, as Bradford Plumer points out in paragraph 9, ""60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"". Some people may also say that the Electoral college encourages the president to visit all states, when in fact smaller states still are not treated the same as states with more electoral votes. A president would rather spend their time investing and giving information to a state such as california who have 55 electoral votes, who feel more inclined to think about their decision due to their involvement, rather than a state with 3 electoral votes who dont invest as much thought into their votes.

In grade school we are taught that popular votes most accurately represent what a specific population wants, why dont we use it in the real world? If your principle wanted to figure out what color the students wanted their yearbooks, she would not elect people to decide for each class! In the Bush and Gore election, Bush received less votes by the American people but won presidency because he acquired more Electoral votes than Gore. That means that more American people wanted Gore, but the fate was chosen by 271 people, who selected Bush as the winner!

The Electoral College also increases the risk of a tie and if one occurred, the election would be disrupted by the unorderly process of which we would have to take to decide the president. In 1968, a change of votes from just 41,971 people would have tied the electoral votes due to the even number of 538 Electors.

The overall idea im trying to express is that the Electoral College is a poor way to show peoples opinion, and much rather focuses on that of 270 individuals who in the end, decide the President of the United States. I hope you can see my points and I long for the day when the president is decided by the people.",0
"Do you own a car? Have you ever driven one? Many people would answer yes to these questions, and would agree that cars , in fact, are very useful. But have you ever thought of the adavantages that would occur if we limited car usage? While cars are very useful, they also have lots of negative side affects that come along with it. Cars accumulate lots of pollution in the enviroment and stress to humans. Also less cars, results in less traffic, which means you will be wasting less of you're life waiting to get somewhere and actually being there in the moment. Whether you realize it or not Americans are already starting to cut down on car uasge. In the article ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it even states ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.""

The world has been struggling with pollution for quite some time now and has been trying to come up with ways to cut it down. So why not start with where it derives from the most? Cars. Pollution by cars got so bad in Paris that they had to use license plate numbers to decide what cars could drive on certain days! But what did happen was ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog."" (Duffer). That is amazing! Just five days of less car usage and the smog went down 60 precent. Pollution would drop in great precentages if we just cut down car usage a bit. Pollution will always be harmful to the world, but steps should be taken to harm the world as little as possible.

Stress is something everyone experiences, but it is safe to say that everyone could do with less of it. Cars cause lots of stress to humans. A city in Germany does not allow cars and a women from the city says ""When I had a car I was always tense."" (Rosenthal). She is much more relaxed now and does not need to worry about all the stress that comes along with owning a car. Another person from Bogota, Columbia, where they have a car-free day, says ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress..."" (Selsky). People all around the world are reporting that their lives are a lot less stress free when they do not own cars. Stress is something that can be very damaging to a human when in large amounts and just cutting down on driving takes away lots of that stress.

Everyone has been stuck in traffic from time to time, and for some people in small cities, five minutes could be a long time to be stuck in traffic. But for some people in big cities like New York City and Los Angelos, people waste hours stuck in traffic! When you accumulate all those hours stuck in traffic, that is a lot of your time wasted in just waiting to get from desitination A, to destination B. Those hours could be spent on actually being there in the moment at the destination you want to be at. ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009....."" (Rosenthal), many people now-a-days just want to get to the place that they are going to, as fast as possible; whether that be by car-pooling, taking the bus, or biking. Car usage is already decreasing, but that advantage should be taken that people want to live in the moment more and car usage should be even more cut down.

Car usage may never be completely taken away, but it defintley can be lowered. The advantages and benefits of just less car usage is astonishing. Less pollution to help the world, less stress to help the people, and letting people live life in the moment more are all advantages the derive from cutting down on the usage of cars. It may be diffcult to let go of something many people hold on to so dearest, but it is a change the will benefit us. While cars may have its pros, its cons outweigh it in the end.",0
"The use of technology can be operated for many different reasons. Is technology valuable for emotional expressions of students in a classroom?

Everyone has their own opinion in the use of technology based on facial expressions. In my opinion, I believe reading emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. This can be taught as if you we're being instructed by math. You may be thinking to yourself ""How can this be possible for a computer to be recognized by a facial expression?"" According to the passage, the computer process begins using a 3-D computer model of the face. The appromixate number of 44 muscles must move just like a human. A man, Dr. Paul Eckman created six different emotions such as, happy, surprised, angry, sad, fear, and disgust. Then each characteristic would be assocaiated by the moventment of the facial muscles.

This technology can be helpful for students because of new emotion-recognized software tracks these facial movements. By weighting the different units, the software can identified by the using mixed emotions. Each emotion is compared against neutral face, in other words no expression shown. You can tell the difference of a person's face of how they're feeling just by looking at their face. But they might alsp, have other feelings within inside them. The new software stories similar anatomical information as an electic code.",0
"Dear State senator, A lot of chatter about weather the president should be elected by electoral college or by popular vote is going around my school for the past couple of weeks, and i can't help but to give my own opinion about this argument. I believe that the popular vote should decide who is the president.

I believe this because of two reasons. One, the citizens are the ones that are going to have to deal with this good or bad president for four years and possibly eight years. Also the satate senators can be bribed by one or the other candidates running for president. This candidate could have the worst plans for the next four years and all because he cheated to win. This could cause riots and prawns around the United States.

Two, Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the winnertakeall system. What this means is that candidates are not going to focus on the staes that they know they wont get any votes from. for example in source tw, during the campaign of 2000, seventeen states were not visited by either candidates so they didn't get to see any campaign ads. this is unfair because it makes it harder, almost impossible for these states to choose on who to vote for because they had no presentations to choose from. this puts to much power in the candidates hands.

Some may believe otherwise. For example, since the Electoral votes are from very experienced people that have put there life and time into knowing about what is right and wrong. they are much more experience than the normal citizens. Also Electoral College prevents runoff elections to occur. for example in source three, the electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes casted. This causes lots of pressure which would greatly complicate the presidential election process. With Electoral Collage, this produces a clear winner.

In my own opinion the one that decideds the winner is popular votes. There can still be Elector Collage votes, but the Electoral votes have to much power and is unfair to the citizens of the united states.",0
"There have been many claims about the Face being a sign of intelligent life forms on Mars. The Face is not an extraterestrial artifact. It is just a natural landform. By looking at the images from 1976 and 1998 I can see where someone might mistake it for a humaniod face. The images are a little blurry and because of this you can see what appears to be eyes, a nose and a mouth.

Upon closer inspection of the 2001 image you can see it is just a natural landform such as a mountain that formed from the wind blowing sand over the years. NASA has done scientific research to prove to you that the Face isn't really a face, it's just a mountain that resembles one.

There have been many claims of extraterestrial life forms on Mars. Most of these claims lack evidence. There may still be life on Mars, but we have yet to gather any real evidence. I assure you that the Face is nothing more than a natural landform that shadows had an effect on to make it appear to resemble a monument. If it wasn't for the high resolution camera that was used to take the 2001 image of the Face, we might still believe it to be an extraterestrial monument.",0
"Why should we study the Venus as a worthy pursuit? going to Venus we will discover a lot of new things that we didn't know about. When going to Venus you can give away the curiosity's that people may have on the planet. But going to Venus could be a risk factor or it can be something that we discover and put it on earth.

In the passage the author states that traviling to Veuins is going to be a challenge but is still wanting to make a pursuit to go. In paragraph five the author states that

''(NASA) has one particularly compeling idea for sending humans to study Venus''. The author states NASA to show that a very big company wants to know what is up in Venus, so it should be studieded. In paragraph eight the author states that ''Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has valued, not only because of the insights to be gained on the planet itself''. This shows that the author says taking a challnge is a good thing when you want to find something out, so take challenges. In paragrqph four the author says ''If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientist even disscusing further visits to its surface''. The author uses this to ask a question to have you thinking to show that even scientist are curious about the planet Venus and the readers should be to. In paragraph one the author explains what other people think about they say that Venus is a evening star so the author is saying that there are miths about Venus, so the author trys to explain that traviling to Venus will take away the curiositys so, it might be a new way to discover new things to bring back to earth to share with the world; because it can advance things. The author uses alot of questions to show what he is refering to with traviling to Venus and making the reader aprove with his oppinion. In paragraph seven he states that ''some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simbulating the chaos of Venus surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. This shows that NASA was conducting experiments where a computer can take such bad climate.

The author uses alot of questions to show that what they are talking about is true and they even had evidence to support there idea. They even used other researchers oppinons like NASA and other scientist to show that they are also on the authors side so should Venus be traviled?.",0
"To many, it is a necessity. To others, its a waste of money. Cars have been a growing industry ever since the ModelT, but over the last few years automobiles may soon start to look like a thing of the past. There have been many efforts to reduce car use because it is better for the environment, creates a more social atmosphere, and the best of all it is cheaper.

Could you imagine major streets, cities, and highways almost deserted of those four wheeled gas guzzlers? Well annualy in Bogota, Columbia citizens participate, or for many ""celebrate"" no car day. Other forms of transportation such as skating, biking, or walking are very common as violaters of no car day face twenty five dollar fines. Many enjoy the holiday like Carlos Plaza, who rode his twoseat bike to work with his wife. It is a day to be socializing with others, not locked up in your vehicle but to get out and enjoy the fresh air before it is all polluted and blown out the exhaust. The day alone has caused a blooming of parks, and restraints throughout the city. With less drivers out on the road, this day is traffic free and extremely safe as well. This is not only a common trend in Colombia, but is beginning to be seen in the United States as well. Teens have begun using their summerlife to being in carpools or riding the bus to not only get around environmentally, but to also meet and be with friends and develop a more social community. This can be seen through carpooling apps and cell phones to arrange other forms of transportation.

Over the years there has been a push to use more ecofriendly cars such as hybrids, or electric cars. But what about not driving a car at all? Many have made this change in Vauban, Germany where residents of this upperclass community have gone motor free, and given up cars. This suburban area alone is a huge effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, similar to citizens in paris who have lost their driving privileges due to the extreme amount of smog in their city. By banning odd numbered plates from driving on monday, and even numbered plates from driving on tuesday, pedestrians hopped on trams and bicycles to commute the rest of their day. Each time you firie up your engine, carbon monoxide and other pollution gas is released into the atmosphere, causing a widening hole in the ozone layer affecting Global Warming. In this twoday restriction, smog was significantly reduced throughout the city.

Many gimmance and frown as they fill up their gas tank, knowing they just spent forty dollars on gasoline, and will be right back at the same pump next week. Money makes the world go around, and spending less on cars, highways and other expenses could brighten anyones day. It is absolutely free to get to work on a bicycle, and New Yorks bike sharing program has significantly jumped inthe last few years as many would rather use manpower than horsepower to travel. Not just bikes but other services are cheaper as well like taking the bus, the few dollars for a bus pass or a train ticket is much less than a new toyota. The infamous no car day in Colombia has influenced money to be spent on wide, and smooth sidewalks for bikers instead of million dollar highways. Due to the recession, many are not buying cars or getting their license simply because they dont have the resources to afford one. Some believe the idea of a personal car is impractical says Bill Ford of Ford Motor Company. Bill believes it is best to use the comercial network of transportation for its lower cost, eco friendly, and a safer environment on the road.

Since the beginning of man all forms of transportation have been used, but are cars starting to become a thing of the past? On paper, the idea of not owning personal cars looks great. The environment would improve significantly, daily interactions with comuting to work develops a more social enviroment, and is of course cost reductive. So every once in a while don't be afraid to pedal the old Shwinn or hop on the Greyhound, it just might be better than you think.",0
"Of course, many people from all over the world are using cars for everywhere they go, however Elisabeth Rosenthal, Robert Duffer, and Andrew Selsky agree that the reduction of the usage of cars will benefit us an abundant amount. Therefore, if we all used our cars less, it will benefit our health, benefit our financial problems, and benefit our environment.

Duffer and Rosenthal tells us about how using less cars will benefit our health. It would make us healthier by cleaning the up the pollution and smog in the air. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog.."" 14 This is saying that people in France were becoming significantly healthier in just 5 days without the use of cars. Not only only does it make you less sick, but it reduces stress. It reduces stress because you dont have to worry about maintaining a car. ""When i had a care i was always tense. im much happier this way"" 3 This is saying that its less stressful not having car, and makes people happier. Health is a primary factor in our lifes and taking cars away puts us in a better position.

Rosenthal and Selsky tell us about how using less cars will benefit our financial problems. It would make us more money because they are not spending so much on gas, and components to keep the car in condition to drive. ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" 29 This is saying that people are not on the road alot, and if people arent on the road alot, they are not spending money. Not only does it save money on cars, but it helps you use other ways to get to places that arent expensive. It isnt expensive because people can find alternatives that dont need gas, and so much maintance. ""In a program that's set to spread to other countires, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday.."" 20 This is saying that because they dont need to use cars and there are differerent routes to take, the need to spend money on transportation decreases. Money is important to gets the necessities we humans need, so saving is a big deal.

Rosenthal and Selsky tells us about how using less cars will benefit our environment. It would better the environment because people will learn to communicate better. ""Likewise the rise in cell phones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of share can services for getting to work."" 35 This is saying that people learn how to share and to help one another out. Not only does it help communication, but it also helps helps people get outside and be active. It helps people get active because is they dont have cars, they have to keep themselves occupied or if they want to get to places, they have to walk, bike, etc. ""Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city: uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks.."" 28 This is saying that that the city is working with the people to help make the environment a better place with no cars. The environment is an important factor as well because we have to take care of the place we live in.

In conclusion, Rosenthal, Selsky, and Duffer have shown that the reduction of the usage of cars will help us tremendously, and that having a healthier life, a greater amount of money, and a better environment will change the world.",0
"Dear Senator, What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you think of the Presidential elections? Do you think about the complicated electoral college or the popular vote? As an average citizen who is not in politics i immediately think of the popular vote when it comes to the Presidential elections. Why do we have the electoral college anways? Shouldn't the people be able to decide who the president is not the state legislature.

SO therefore instead of the electoral college we should just stick to the popular vote.

As an American you have certain unalienable rights, and the act of voting is one of them. So if its our right to vote than we should be able to do it not other people. The electoral college isnt that safe either. In 1960 as stated in the text, when President Kennedy ran for office segregationist in the state of Louisiana nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic voters elected by the people with voters who would have voted against Kennedy. Or in 2000 when Al Gore won the popular vote but George W. Busch won the electoral vote and caused the biggest election scandal of the century. These are just a few examples of instances where the majority has won but the electoral college has caused an issue in the election. I am unsure of your preferences over popular or electoral but who the majority of the American people decide should become the President. We shouldnt allow some 538 politicians out of some 3 million citizens to choose the President. The American people should choose all of us not 538.

Though our founding fathers decided that we needed a system to decide the President instead of letting the people decide times have changed. Scandals have taken place, and issues have risen. But yet we still use this process even though we have an election all it does it we elect a select few to represent us. Why cant we just pick right away? The Constitution of the United States of America is based off of a democracy where the people run the government through our elected officials. Nowhere does it say that we elect people to elect the president. That doesnt sound like the country electing the president it sounds like a few ""qualified people"" electing the president.

So Senator I ask you that you make a motion to eliminate the electoral college. All it does is take away our rights as citizens to elect our officials. It has caused many scandals as well. So please I hope you can agree that we need to eliminate the electoral college and only use the popular vote.",0
