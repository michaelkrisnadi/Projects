However, in recent times, car usage has significantly decreased due to its beneficial effect on many communities. Based on the information given, there are many advantages of limiting car usage.\n\nOne of many advantages of limiting the usage of cars is that it can help the community. With lower car usage, the community's environment can potientally become much better. According to Source 2, France's partial driving ban caused its congestion to go \"down 60 percent... after five-days of intensifying smog.\" This drastic change in France's car traffic prevented further pollution and smog, which hurts the community. Addtionally, limiting car usage can push more people into excercising more. In Bogota, Colombia, many Colombians \"hiked, biked, skated...\" during their car-free days (source 3). Also, many \"parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city\" (source 3). With an increase of excercise, the community's people will not only become healthier and fitter, but prevent any more damage to the community.\n\nFuthermore, lowering car uage will benefit the community's patrons by providing a cleaner lifestyle. With limiting their car usage, the people of the community will save more money. According to Source 1, although cars aren't recommended, a car-owner may \"buy a space, for $40,000, along with a home (source 1).\" Normally, a decent size house is approximately $100,000 to $ 150,000 with parking as well. To add onto this, gas prices can become very expensive, especially to those to drive a lot. All this money spent on a pollution causing car can be put towards a child's education, or the community's benefit. Plus, the stress of ensuring a car's wellbeing at all times is eliminated as well, decreasing the amount of stress in citizens. Addionally, people are more happy with limited usage of cars. People like Heidrun Walter have said \"I'm much happier this way (source 1),\" because they feel safer and can provide more to the community. Happier people in the community leads a much cleaner, stress-free lifestyle where its inhabitants are able to thrive more.\n\nThe advantages of limiting car usage includes assisting the community and providing a cleaner lifestyle for its patrons. With a positive community, the future generation's lifes will be enhanced. The youth of a community with a great outlook on the world will provide futher citizens with another fantasic community with the potential to grow and change. However, without this, the community will not thrive nor grow."}]}

The leading reason to distracted driving is cell phones. While most people appear to be aware of the dangers of using the cellphone while driving, they even continue to take this risk. What would it take to make people to quit utilizing their cell phones while operating their car?\n\nCell phones have become a part of many people's daily lives, making it a struggle for them to sit the down long enough to drive and reach their destination. In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were calculated to have cellphones in hand while behind the wheel. Cellphone usage while traveling has become the number one cause for vehicle accidents over the last two decades.\n\nUsing the phone while driving increases not only the driver, but the people around them chances of getting into an accident. In addition to it lessens the driver's awareness of their surroundings while on the road, causing more car accidents. \"Auto deaths have risen for two straight years, marking the biggest increase in more than dive decades. While lower gas prices have encouraged more driving, distracted driving due to cellphones has been tapped as one of the major causes. That has prompted many states to begin cracking down on phone use while driving with laws outlawing the behavior.\" (Pressman, A..Apr.2017)\n\nAn increasing amount of states, prohibit the usage of cell phones while behind the wheel, exposing those drivers who break the laws to fines and additional punishments. What many drivers don't realize is that, not only could they receive fines for using their phone, but they could also be served with serious lawsuits if they cause an accident.\n\nA large number of drivers do not believe that their driving performance is impacted by the usage of their cellphones. More than one half of drivers who speak on cell phones while driving feel as if their driving is no different from them being off the phone. This shows that many people are ignorant to the impact they have on their selves and others when they use their phones while driving. This also shows why it's so important to have such strict rules and laws. \"Road safety appears to improve in states with laws that regulate driver's phone use. The states with the lowest amount of phone use while driving- Vermont, Oregon, Hawaii, and Washington- have all banned the use of handheld devices behind the wheel.\"(Johnson, D.Apr.2018)\n\nTo sum it up, the use of phones while driving has proven to be a huge safety hazard to drivers and those surrounding them. There should be laws in all states and even countries that ban the use of any device or distraction while driving in order to decrease the number of accidents on the road. It would also help people to practice using their phones less and become not so dependent on their phones."}]}

I agree, but it'll be too dangerous and very risky. But before that lets learn about Venus and whats its about. Tune in to find out!\n\nIn the article it states, \"Venus, sometimes called the \"Evening Star,\" is one of the brightest planets in the night sky, making it simple to catch in the night. In our solar system, Venus is right next to our sun. Venus is ovbisouly simple to see, but very hard to study it. Venus is called the Earth's twin, becuase of their size and density, density meaning how big and large it is. Venus goes at different speeds then the other planets.\"\n\nNow that you know somethings about Venus according to my sources, lets get into it if you should study it or not. Personally based on what I read, I would agree to study it up close. But, it'll be very dangerous. NASA is going to have to do a lot of work to get job done. It's not going to be easy, you can't just go up there and expect to study a large, massive planet. A lot of stuff goes into doing these type of things. Venus according to the article, \"Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system.

They just need to do little to a lot more work and the job will be done. To me, I feel like NASA can do it, I mean what can't they do. They think the impossible and create the impossible. Whoever are the people going up there... make it happen!\n\nTherefore, I know it's a tough task, but I know they can do it. I mean, like I said, what can't NASA do. They think the impossible then do the impossible."}]}

The \"car free\" trend is beginning to spread throughout the world, and even to places in America. By limiting car usage, the state of the environment improves, a more healthy lifestyle is promoted, and opportunities for other innovations are brought into the light.\n\nIn Paris, a driving ban was enforced to help clear the air of polluants. This ban lowered the congestion by 60 percent, and according to reporter Robert Duffer, \"The smog rivaled Bejing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.\" Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gasses in Europe, and up to 50 percent in areas where cars are used more often, such as the United States. The Environmental Protecion Agency is promoting car reduced communities in America, where even legislators are beginning to act. By elimitating cars from the everyday equation, one also eliminates the greenhouse gasses and other pollutants, which makes the planet a healthier place to live.\n\nWith less and less cars being utilized, there are more opportunites for people to get active by biking, walking, and participating in other active means of getting from point A to point B. According to news reportes Andrew Selsky and Elisabeth Rosenthal, \"The swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occassional distant moter\", and \"Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks.\" Without cars, citizens are encouraged to get active. Condensed cities allow people to walk to their destination, which drastically improves an individual's heart health, along with aerobic activity such as biking.\n\nAn official from Transportation for America says, \"All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change.\" Sociologists believe that America has passed peak driving, and cars are no longer the focus of improvement. The Internet makes telecommuting possible, which is much more convenient than using automobiles because people can feel connected without the drive. This and the rise in cellphones implies that while innovations used to be focused on transportation, telecommuting is the new big thing.\n\nWith many areas participating in the eventual elimination of automobiles, many are following suit. Sociologists believe that cars will eventually disappear. By cutting down on our usage of cars, we help the enviromnent, promote health, and focus innovations elsewhere."}]}

Ever sience the first picture of the face came out in 1976. Some people say it was made by aliens. While other say it is a natural rock formation. I am here to tell you that it is a nautral rock formation, by picture and other edivence.\n\nThe first pieace of edivence are the picture that were taken by Viking 1 and MGS, Mars Global Survey. In 1976 it looks like a face, but we didn't have the technology that we have. The first picture was 43 meters per pixel, which is a lot. Now if this technology advance we now get 1.56 meters per pixel, so if the face on Mars was really set up by aliens we would see their huts or anything else they built. The second piece of edivence is shadows, as you can see in the pictures it is just how the sun is position and how the statlite is postion to make it look like a face. The last reason is other natural sites that have the same size and looks like the face on Mars. The face on Mars reminds the Auroth of a place in Idaho. It is a Butte in the Snake river Plain. It is almost the same size and shape.\n\nIn conclusion the face of Mars is a natural site, and not made by aliens. I know because of the picture of the face of Mars.

Not only Americans, but people all around the world such as people from Germany, France, etc. Reasonings for the recent drop in car usage is that there are problems with air pollution, bikes and other transportations that do not involve the use of cars also give place more space to make more town centers and sports complexes, and cars can be a very difficult machine that causes many problems for people everyday.\n\nSmog has become a very big problem for France. France has blamed diesel fuel as the reason for the smog problems. Diesel is favored more than gasonline due to a tax policy, diesel makes up over 67 percent of vehicles in France. The smog in France was so heavy that it, \"rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world\" according to an article by Robert Duffer. Smog is a very big issue that should not be taking place it can cause many health problems. France decided that the smog was getting out of hand so they began a \"Car-free day\", this meant that people would not be using their cars for a whole day and some people would not agree with this idea. France started these \"Car-free days\" with the people who had even numbered license plates and then the next day would have cars with odd numbered license plate would not drive their cars. The consequence for not following this rule was a $31.00 or 22-euro fine. Many people were fined the next few days and twenty seven people had their cars impounded due to their reaction of the fine. This \"Car-free day\" helped to reduce the smog problem in France.\n\nWhen people use any type of transportation other than a car they would be able to have many more places to go and have a good time. When people are using cars and other motor vehicles they are also causing more and more construction for new roads and places for cars to be able to park. If people rode bikes and walked more than we would have more places for people to build shops and complexes that are all together and easy to get to. In Vauban, Germany most residents there live a life without the use of cars. \"The streets of Vauban are completely \"car-free\"- except the main thoroughfare\", stated in the Article by Elisabeth Rosenthal. Only 30 percent of people in Vauban's familys own cars, the other 70 percent do not own cars. More than half of that 70 percent sold their cars just to live in Vauban. In Vauban they have begun to create more sidewalks that are better accesible for bikes and walking. This has created more room for people to construct new stores and places that are walkable distance for citizens, so less car usage could lead to many new places such as shops, stores and even new sports complexes.\n\nCars can be very difficult machines that cause many problems for people everyday. They can just stop in a matter of seconds and people would not know what happened, causing people to get their cars checked out at a car-shop and paying more money to get the problem fixed. If people began walking or using bikes as transportation they would not only be saving money but would lower the problems they would be having getting to and from places. Not using cars can save so much money for people because they would not have to pay much gas and they would not have to go to get their cars fixed almost every year. Even with bikes there might be a problem such as getting a flat tire or the chain popping off, even those little things would cost only a few dollars where as a trip to the car-shop would cost a least $100.00 out of pocket.\n\nLimiting the use of cars can potentially save places from smog and more air pollution. Not using cars as much can leave more space for places to be built, instead of using the space as a parking lot people could use that space as a place for shopping or sports complex. Car-free day could even be a very helpful idea that might change the peoples minds to use other types of transportations besides a car. Having no cars could save a numerous amount of money for a lot of people. They will save money by not having to get a lot of gas and they will save money on not having to fix their cars almost every year. So limiting the use of cars could become a potential idea that can help people around the world."}]}

These past years a lot of teenagers were killed because of people using their phones while driving. Most people think they know how to text and drive but they don't. I don't think people should use their phones and drive even if they think they know how to, anything can happen in a split second.\n\nTexting & driving is more debilitating to your reaction time than driving while under the influence of alcohol. As crazy as it sounds its true people tend to crash more likely while using a device and driving than under the influence. We are so focused on social media or other people texting us that most of the time we aren't paying attention to the road. Even if you're at a red light and you use your phone your still most likely to crash because of the fact of the fact that you're not aware when the light turns green. If you simply cannot resist the urge to check messages or talk on the phone while driving, take the time to pull off of the roadway and park your vehicle before picking up your cell phone.\n\nDriving other people in your vehicle is a huge responsibility, which most of teenagers take that lightly. Sending or reading a text message while driving puts your passengers lives at a significantly higher risk of being involved in an accident while riding in your vehicle. Could you live with the fact that your decision to pick up your phone while Driving someone to suffer a life-lasting injury or be killed? Humans are smaller and less noticeable than vehicles making it more likely of you seeing a pedestrian in your peripheral vision while looking at your phone.\n\nIn most states texting and driving is illegal but people don't care and continue doing it. If you are caught by the police using your mobile device and obtaining a vehicle at the same time, most likely you're going to get a couple hundred dollars fine. Looking at a message that says \"ok\" isn't worth getting in trouble with the law."}]}

More than half of the people in the house are rushed to the hospital. As you can see there has been an atrocious accident because of that vehicle. Their should definitley be a limiting of car usage because their would be less car accidents , people would be able to spend less money on cars and we would have less air pollution. Also having a car can cause a lot of stress or tension for people.\n\nObviously we're having a lot of problems with money in this world , if we limit car usage that would really help is us out a lot. See as it states in source one paragraph two '' A car-owner buys a space, for forty thousand dollars , along with a home.'' With those forty thousand dollars you can do a lot to help the world . It aslo says that fifty seven percent of the people who live in a suburban area sold their cars just move where they live at now. Who needs a car when you can just walk ''stores are placed a walk away, on a main street rather than the malls along some distant highway. ''source one paragraph 6.\n\nPollution is destroying our world and we need to help stop it, so here's an idea lets ban driving due to smog says Paris. Their was an enforced partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Do you agree with that? well I do and here's why . Paris has more smog than other European capitals so if they don't stop the smog it's going to be horrific for their city. Source three paragraph twenty one '' the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.'''Not having cars for one day is brilliant idea because is an improvement to the city of Bogota.\n\nTheir is a lot of disruptions an accidents going on because of cars mainly because of the traffic so if their was less cars it would be more peaceful. Usually when there's traffic you hear a lot honking and there's a lot fines for that. The fines are very expensive to pay so you're wasting a lot of money. Also when people are honking they don't realize that other people are sleeping . Everyone needs sleep , some people can't sleep through everything so all it takes is one honk and bam they're awake. Sleeping is really needed in your life imagine notgetting enough sleep because of traffic well yeah that would suck an a lot of people already go through that .\n\nSo in conclusion what I'm saying is car usage should definitly be limited at least in some countries or states. Money is a really big problem we have that needs to be solved and this is a great way. People living in a surburan area have to pay more just for extra parking places. Air pollution is very bad for the world with les cars that will stop as well. Traffic is not good for the world either because it is stressful an it is not good for people to be stressed."}]}
