"The Venusians... Face of Mars... Martians??? Well according to Dr . Kia it's completely plausible  that there is life on Venus mean heck people live in ""one of the most similar places no earth."" These people (7,000,000+) seem to be doing fine with how they live. They don't sufficate to the presence of CO2 all day like we sufficate the type of car we see on a daily basis. What makes the newspapers, T.V's, news stations, anything claiming there are Venusians, truthul? Same with the martian operation, what solid proof is there that they did find bacteria on Mars. People just believe it's official beacuse of an article in a newspaper which honestly who knows where all the the correct facts are. Let's not be so quick to believe the hype of Venusians, Aliens, Martians w/e other type of life form like people on the Venus campaign trail. Life outside of earth is very plausible.

What even are Venusians? Aliens, little Venus people? Is ""Venusians"" even a word? Who knows? Is it just another one of the lies told by the media? People? Probably not. The whole ""surprise de Valles"" as some call it seems to be a huge place of lfe on Venis. Dr Carrol Hood explains it all in a few articles through the Washington Post. ""Smog clears to reveal humans in one of harshest places on Earth."" Then, "" Life on Venus? It's not as crazy as you might think."" Hold on take into consideration what life would be like in Australia, more specifically what life is like in the Australian Outback. Similar to Venus with it being know as one of th most similar places on Earth so not as crazy as you may think. To the people that believe there are Venusians it seems official to them like it was ""reported on Sept. 20 in a paper that appeared in a western Europe science journal."" Aliens are like the Venus Venus state but, I'm not claiming anyone as a Venusian.

Did the mars operation find life on Mars? Media and news reports claim they did. Do you believe it from one article you've probably seen on Twitter or other source of sch.

I mean we do know it happened! How so? This article was ""based on a much-anticipated presentation by the mission's leader, Dr. Vlada Stamenkovic, at a conference here of the American Geophysical Union."" So yeah we're going to believe it' official just because the two articles you've probably seen on a fact check like Snopes said it happened.

I'm a news reporter who gets a story about dying life on Mars. Understand this could be a sensitive topic but, I really want to get the WHOLE story. So for a big, breaking news piece I'm going to say it's OFFICIAL first. Then eventually later on im going to REALIVE(tm) that it could've been an accident what happened which is what almost everyone thought. Love Airways magazine is known for the facts. Headlines like Love TRIALS Galaxy's Most Reliable Planets"" So when they publish ""End of Operation Mars 2023"" people are going to believe what they said. So answer the hype of the life on mars happeneed... im clever. AssemblyFileVersion.",1
"The author of The Challenge of Exploring Venus suggested to study venus is a worthy pursuit despite it condtions and or dangerous risks. I think the author thinks studying Venus is worthy based of the author saying in Paragragh five althought it is 170° F(Fahrenheit) it may be difficultt condtions, but it still survivable for humans.

More evidence of it being worthy of studying is in Paragragh seven saying NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. From one of there examples, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venuss surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions, meaning it is possible to find research. Research is our only way of getting data proven in Paragragh six stating ""researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks"".

And my final piece of evidance stating it is worthy of studying Venus is in Paragragh's six and eight ""peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""",0
"The following quick essay as been given to address the authencity of the Venus of Willendorf as an African made Sculpture.

The Venus of Willendorf is believed to be an African made sculpture, there have been many different theories on where it comes from but its said to be a Fisher on the African Island of Lespugne who discovered the missing piece of art in the year 1908. There is very little detail left on the Venus of Willendorf giving the theory a large amount of Eleanor of other theories.

It's obviously hard to tell whether this work of art is African or another race but with the given information on it being African, it justify's that the Venus of Willendorf is African made. The reason its seen to be African is because of the neck of what supposed to be the head, the practice of elongating the neck is a type of tradtion which is actually practiced in parts of modern-day Africa.

We have seen this practice on a Tanzanian tribe, The Padaung of Burma where the women Wrap copper coils around their necks to elongate them and to us it is seen as beautiful where others may think the opposite. Despite the opposing views in beauty, cultures around the world still have practices that are the same as the others.

Knowing this as common knowledge that different people in different cultures practice similar customs, it helps us justify whether this work of art is made by African's. Meaning it justifiy's to side with the fact that the Venus of Willdendorf is African made.

With this being an African sculpture, there is a higher chance of it being discovered in Lespugne of Africa. Others may argue that it still could've been taken to this Island or another part of Africa but it' proven to be difficult to move ancient relics like the Venus of Willendorf because it's not worth the money it would cost to move it from one location to another.

So in order for it to have moved, it would have had to been part of a much larger migration of people, but because it was carried along on beach vacation's makes it less likely to have possibly moved the Venus of Willendorf to Lespugne or Africa.

In conclusion, because of the fact that it's hard to move precious relics like the Venus of Willendorf, and common knowledge of people in other cultures being influenced by the practices of other cultures proves that the Venus of Willendorf is indeed an African made sculpture.",1
"Venus could present a new ground on which to lay ideas and should be taken into more consideration in our spacial explorations. As quoted from the article, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" - ""The chalenge of eploring venis.""

Selling ourselfs short on the idea of researching venus and its potential gain will never allow us to advance. Furthermore the information gather could provide insight on the distruction of our so called ""sister planet"" which was once thought to be able to carry orginisms of life. The various rock formations such as mountains, valleys, and volcanoes can also prove that restoration may be possible. What we need is a push a way to udilize our limitation and to research which the aurhtor of the article does a great idea of explaining.

He states that using a ship floating above the surface at a safe heght; would allow for the dangers to be minimized. The only problem would be that the clouds block the view from even our most advanced of cameras.

Although as stated in paragraph 8 ""...human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" in which we believe we can surpass and exceed.",0
"The discovery of an ancient tomb in Paraguay offered a glimpse into a first-of-its-kind Vaemi exceptional to the region, inspiring scientific intrigue nationwide. This lower level space of barely three meters of depth harbored advanced architecture, mysterious carvings, and unusually long humans things that could be explained by aliens just as easily as ancient populations. Along with many scholars, I dissuade the general public of the likelihood of aliens by examining the mystery of the Paraguayan poltergeist, the potential for engineering feats by ancient humans, and the complexity of communicating a worldwide conspiracy.

Many skeptics search for explanations to events they do not understand, and the goverment of Paraguay is no exception. Various news articles and interviews with experts soon headlined their news sources, contesting that ""I, for one, do not believe in little green men as the cause for ..., many had suggested UFOs as the cause, which has lead to . . ."" within days of any event at the most. Surpassing the scientific mind with any change over the normal routine in the world of Paraguay likely spells aliens, however, in the rest of the civilized world, the simplest and least sensational answer usually takes the cake. While it is common to explain the unexplained with aliens in movies and TV, simple explanations, many of them with solid grounding in the world of science, are up to bat to answer the tough questions. Moreover, explaining the more fantastic theories behind most any advanced event, product, or salute in Paraguay would indeed be very, very difficult. In the city, with our current amount of advanced technology, such a claim would be torn down by the average mind within a minute of scruitny.

If even a single stone, rock, or pebble adjactent to an incursion of floppy UFO spawn-inhibiting tubes were to fracture even a little under the stress of such an event, almost every advanced wormhole-driving space-travel method we've given a generous portion of the Paraguayan budget to would be de-exploded extremely violently. Forbes explains the plight of the scientists, saying the stone bed wrecked ""their best-laid blowing-stuff-up plans, caused millions in property damage . . ."" pebbles adjacent to alien landings would very quickly exceed any structure's hard-to-smash-through containment strips. Considering the fact that the average person from here-to-A-Passageway would have its more-than four hundred million doubloon wormhole extender crush said stone bed at any plausible rate of speed, it's pretty safe to say underground Vaemis just aren't a thing that's going to happen here.

The first thing that anyone asks about a flying saucer found in a Parguayan's backyard that is constantly buzzing downtown's citizens up all about is 'What could have man made that?' In most any advanced event in the modern world, the blame points to the nearest human. Not because humans tend to break things more often that we'd like to admit, but because humans can man or woman up and tell you what dongus fiddled the whatcha this time. One you get past technical, and even basic electronics, many people jut can't deal with the broken, the confused, and the ignorance of others who think they know what they're talking about. Technical support has made quite a headway in this area, leading most of Paraguay to handle extraterrestrial wizzgig-repair.

Car manufacturing in the modern era is too complicated for most car owners to properly deal with their machines. Car manufactureres are somewhat required-by customery to give out very detailed user's manuals about how to take care of things like changing tires, checking brake fluids, and fickle fuel injection pumps. With todays' advanced warp-drive quantum megarhombos explodinitis, people have no way of learning how the thing that propels more than one million dollars in spaceship and several million in missles into the sky, and they have no way of telling that their nuclear missile-rays were acting up after that wild swing-by of Betelgeuse. It's not just space macines, either, most of the time if your microwave is acting up you juzejyggeben to Williams-Sonoma, who has to tell you what you've been doing wrong for their twenty-sixty thousand dollar microwaves.

"I see that you believe that the Face could mean that there are or were a sort of life form on Mars. This is easy to belive at first glance, but we decided to look further. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over this red planet. The MOC team took a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. This photo revealed a natural landform. This concluded that there was no alien monument on Mars.

But many theorists, like yourself, stayed unconvinced. Again on April 8, 2001 another photo was taken. This time the photo was taken by Malin's team, and they used the camera's maximum resloution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. This means that if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were. The image taken actually portrays a Martian version of a butte or mesa which are landforms common around the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" says Jim Gravin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program.

Thus, I state my response again: there was no astraterestrial life on Mars.",0

"Having a car now a days is very important and extreamly useful in order to transport yourself from one place to another. However, people don't realize the damage they are causing when using cars or other transporting veichles. Fellow citizens haven't yet understood the advantages of how great it would be to limit car usage.

Citizens should know that limiting car usage is a great a great avantage because it causes less pollution. According to Source 2., after several days or pollutuion Paris mandated a driving ban to clear the air of the global city and about 4,000 drivers were fined for not obeying the regulations. In line 11 it clearly states, ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were odered to leave their cars at home or suffer 22-euro fine $31. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" Paris has pushed so far the ""car-free"" law that they are willing to banned and fine individuals.

"The Venus Car Trap is a story that Carol Emshwiller wrote a Venus tells the story of an interstellar gas-truck that lands to rest and ends up hitting something well their bogy gets kinked in another word they crashed. But ends up surviving their crash and the crew is came. They ended up in the 6th galaxy and that's were the accident happen which Excel is the captain of the crew he is curious of what their ""rare accident"", and theirs always something missing it's so unpredictable. The other crew members aren't as concern for it, but they believe Rollin's girl friend in on of the springs. The boots are smart Sloan notices the springs get pulled wrecking bar was used to smooth out something recent. Now all the guys have razors as-well one of them could of does that but they still think Rollin did it. But it's unknown if he the

""The Venus Car Trap"" has an interesting amount of suspense well adding the mystery and using it in three paragraphs. In the first paragraph is really suspenseful, the crew had no idea what was going to happen since their on Venus, but they had no cares. The second paragraph not suspenseful more mystery, having the crew worry about their accident the whole time their gone can be stressing. The third slightly suspenseful, because the whole crew is on edge since they known something isn't right someone isn't telling

There are some significant events that happens in the Venus Car Trap, but there are also some subtle events but they does an excellent job at least give barely any details and leave you up to think what happened during these small paragraph. The first paragraph the one guy was worried he was like stress about not knowing what's going to happen where we going to trip over something intense that's what happens most

The second paragraph was definitely my favorite the most action and significant events happen here. It sounds like scenes from action packed movies Detron keeps hearing something so they all jump and nothing happens they keep doing it until SKADDING ENDS UP IN THEIR CAR before he starts saying stuff justs know they are backed up by car and wear still days of them being save. But since their in a car with other people their can't just take everyone out of the carsomething

The third paragraph has some more action BARELY, but it's intresting somebody doesn't open to Robots car quick enough. Opposite guy feels uncomfortable and thirty-nine heads inside a home. But what's crazy most likely everybody in that time has car / house issue and I know all of them listen to it and read it and suspense building up to see what's going to happen next would feel really good about themselves because I write how there joursFrais feel to.",1
"Even though technology is a huge part of the world today to help with certain problem and can be really helpful to people. The author describes the FACS or Facial Action Coding System as a technology to shows a recognition to facial movement. In today's society we know that its alot of emotions being shown throughout the world no matter what's the case is. For example, emotions are hidden by certain people or even people that don't show emotions at all. To support my claim is that no matter if parents or anybody tells them something they will not show any type of emotion any type of way, so they use equipment or something such as the FACS technology program.

The author says that from using the FACS experiment that it will make you feel sightly happy. In my opinion that is not true because that when you are down or upset you wouldn't want to do a experiment just to make you feel happy because you would think the experiment was nonsense. The author also provided us with is that if you raises your eyebrowns when your suprises and around your mouth tightens your lips to show anger is true because the FACS could shows and tell your emotion at anytime and any place.

When looking at the Mona Lisa painting it was sucessful and was one of Leonardo da Vinci's biggest accomplishment was the painting of Mona Lisa. Some of the new comptuer software that can recognize emotions, It was sucessful because the software is the latest innovation from Professor Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advance Science at the University of Illinois with collaboration with Professor Nicu Sebe Of the University of Amsterdam.

Comparing school computer and FACS is that school computer can recognize if a students is bored , or even confused about a problem there doing on a website such as Mindplay, Khan Academy , Carnige Learning, and etc. The FACS is extermely helpful and useful is because the FACS materials can be expressive for video games or video surgery. It can also help with human communication that aew nonverbal including emotional communtication. By according to Dr. Huang notes he says "" So computers need to understand that too."".

Your home computer or work computer cannot modify Mona Lisa smile. To support my claim is in pargraph 7 it says "" Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. "" But you can write down some simple instructions that ""encode"" the different emotions.

The author says in Pargraph 9 us that the FACS can give you happy face that it can acutally be useful.

It can be false because a fake smile is when you mouth widen alittle bit with no teeth showing , and when using the FACS it can probably not show it.

The FACS technology can be very helpful for counselor, teachers , deans, doctors and even more. When someone is mentally challenge or mentally disabled the counsleor can uses the FACS to identify the mental person emotions. It can be helpful with teachers and deans is to identify the different or emotion the child has. For examples, say a child is got bully in the cafeteria for his lunch money and he just walks out the cafeteria with a frown on his face and he doesn't want to show his emotion toward the dean and/or teacher so thats when they can used the FACS technology to figure out there emotions.

The FACS is very helpful for humans that performs the same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. Of course, most of us can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look of there face , you can probably tell by the look of there faces when they are happy, sad, worried that why Lenardo da Vinci made the Mona Lisa picture and his crew from making the FACS technology. The author is giving us the mood of encouraging because without the FACS technology then we would never know how people feel when it comes down to the people that don't show emotions.

In conclusion , FACS is very useful in many different sceranio. If it wasnt for the FACS technology then we wouldn't know how kids,adults,students,teachers and etc feel. Another thing is that the FACS technology is very helpful because that it can tell if a student is bored , and/or even tired. While a regular computer can tell if the student is bored. I would reccomend this in schools,hostipals, doctors office , or even in the dentist area.",0
"The face in the vase is a plant that nearly thirty years ago Dr. William A. Schremly cut in half. This plant has amazed many people all over the world. The face in the vase reached all the way to Europe! Scientists were even asking people to ""get their buns down here!"" There's been many idea's and research on the plant. To this day no one knows who it got there.

With all the hinjury in the past thirty years, people have studied the physics of the face in the vase. It was Johannes Riedel who came up with the theory that it nergy from an earthquake almost a year before the face in the vas was discoverd. According to myinfunya.com an earthquake in 1973 caused rock to possibly slide, past the horseshoe-shaped area making the face in the vase. On the same day there was a few large nuclear blasts, an ounced of energy slammed the rock near the energy source point and surpassed the last five percent that was required to free the rock. All the summarized data from Apollo nineteen analyzed to unveil the truth of the energy that caused the rock to fall down. It fits their findings.

A french combinee harverstor company is sued for over their product, they research how the face in the vase is marketed and realize there is a safety problem. NASA sues the Combinee Company for the use of their space technology. They were accused of knowing voyagers on the face in the vas and if the went to Mars and something happened, they could've died. A decade long game of interplanetary got serious.

The face in the vas is formed by natural processes, it was a photosculpture because it was nature that created the face in the vase. Sophisticated European astroscientists agree with the U.S. geologists. It would be just sad if the face in the vase isn't a face at all. It brings happiness to people. More people should look up at the stars, skies and whatever else is above them. It's more beautiful to look at the outside world than the inside.",1
"This new found technology is outstanding and can do marvellous things, however, it is not needed for students in the classroom.

I feel that it would not be as beneficial to students as the author makes it sound. At some point this technology may be helpful for counselors of schools but it is not for daily classroom use.

I am not saying that this technology is not an innovation. It is a tremendous breakthrough to the world of technology. And it could be beneficial to some professions and aspects of life, like psychology, but it just does not apply to students in the same way. The author says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"".

This is not true.

The only way that this could be true is if we replaced human teachers with computers, and that, i think, is a huge step in the wrong direction.

Technology is helpful to the world but to much of it may be a problem that is irreversable.

Furthermore, I think that this technology could be very helpful to high school counselors. With the emotional reader the counselors will be able to identify cases of depression or anxiety or other mental disorders found in high school easier.

In the article it states, ""we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day"". This is referring to the calculating the computer does. It says that we do that to which is true but we are not nearly as precise or efficient. That is why we need this technology or something like it for counselors, to lighten their burdens, but to also ensure that their job gets done.

Finally, I believe that the installation of emotionally sensing computers to every classroom would be a mistake. However, putting them in the hands of counselors would be brilliant. I think that the world should look into this technology more and decide the best uses for it.",0
"A car free campaign is an important movement that everyone should begin to do in order to reduce the extroardinary amount of air pollution,  and increase the amount of physical activity the people living in communities get.  In order to purposely reduce the pollution in the air that is being breathed in, by the people of communities who have no say or control over this, campaigns  (starting in the communities) is how we can make change begin. Over the years these car-free say or ""Día sin autos"" begun in europian communities such as Paris and Rome and quickly begin to impact other communites throught other countries.

The Documenber movie or ""Day of the Driven"" a "" "" An ever increasing amount of people live in these urban communities near highways and heavy traffice points, the pollution is especially burdensome to them. In Bogotá Columbia their weekly car bans reduced the some of the worst traffic in the world. Traffic has signficantly reduced in Paris and seen similar improvement in other cities in other years. ""I love this smog. The city has never looked so beautiful. This is what Sao Paulo should be like all year round,"" says Jonas Dauer, place and time unknown.

Car bans have serious impact on the quality and peformance of urban communities, including the productivity, health, socioeconomics, aesthetics and other quality of life factors. A continous social and political forces however, are essential to trigger changes, especially when they are people of many different backgrounds. A good opportunity for a swing should not result in several cars being destroyed by falling boulders as the does in Monte Carlo Monaco, due to all the rain.

Various typres of soap do lots of damage to an automobile, the runoff enters the enviroment and people. Sociopolitcal tension often works its way out by people taking out their frustrations on inanimate objects, otherwise known as the ""Man stress."" which the cars are often the intended targets.  ",1
"Limiting car usage could come off as absurd to some people. They ask ""Why would I reduce my use of something that gets me to my desired destination the fastest?"" Despite the fact that cars appear to be more conveinient, the harm they do to the Earth far outweighs the benefits. Cars have become more and more prevelant in the entire world since World War II, as society has been built around the car and its ease of use. This unremitting usage of the car has resulted in a shocking amount of pollution to the Earth. The reduction of car usage is advantageous to the environment. Cars produce so much pollution, have a gradual decuction in use would have possitive effects on the environment.

The greatest advantage of limiting car usage is the positive effects it would have on the environment. It is common knowldge that the Earth is in a state of self-destruction, with humans pouring in incredible amounts of greenhouse gases into it. A high percentage of these harmuful emissions come from cars and other gas-powered vehicles. If car usage was limited, a much healthier Earth would result. According to the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" passenger cars were responsible for 12 percent of grenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and nearly 50 percent in highly congested cities across the  United States. With this in mind, cutting these numbers down, even if only in half, would bring about such prosperity to the environemnt that benefits would soon be noticed. These figures show that the reduction of car usage is pivotal in the fight to protect the environment. Also in the article ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog"" it is said that car usage became so heavy in Paris that it developed insane amounts of smog, rivaling that of Beijing, which is one of the most polluted cities in the world. Clearly the root of the problem for Paris was the abundance of car usage, which once limited, reduced the smog greatly. This proves that cars can be a huge problem for the environment, but limiting the usage will have near immediate benefits. Again the environmental benefit of limiting car use is seen in the article ""The End of Car Culture."" The article states that a limit to car usage would ""have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's eissions."" This article does not only say that cars are  large part of pollution, but it also directly claims that less usage would be good for the environment. Limiting car usage is very important to maintaining the Earth as it is now. It is gradually becoming more and more polluted, and the limiting of vehicle use can stop that.

Despite the convenience of the car, it is such a harm to the enironment that its limiting of usage is absolutely neccesary. Several exmaples point out that cars are one of the biggest means of pollution, as it seems everyone is always drving them. Limiting car usage is one of the best things that can be done to save the environement. It is obvious that the preservation of our planet is far more important than the convenience of turning a five minute walk into a short one minute trip. With the ecological benefits of the limit of car usage, this limit of usage is defnitly advantageous.",0
"Only 5% of the world population of about 6 billion people use a car, this not only greatly reduces greenhouse gases, but also gives the world a new look from the roads. Car-free days are starting to become available at some places in the United States and some areas in Europe. Many disruptions and benefits can come from limiting the use of cars worldwide. The advantages include lower air pollution, decreased roadway fatalities and more physical fitness. While the disadvantages consist of difficult shopping and more time consumed in commuting.

Air pollution is reduced with the limitation of people who use cars. In some places in the world they've created a policy, ""Paris has banned driving in the past because of smog, although this year the clean air... even without the partial driving ban... improved 20 percent, due to more telecommuting, car pooling and vacation during the spring sprot. "" According to an article in The New York Times. Paris, the city with possibly the most congested arterials in the western world, had some of the clearest skies.

The car-to-person ration in America on a normal day is about 1.1, but on the superbowl, it was 0.62 according to the article ""No Car Day in the Andes."" Even though the Superbowl was a huge distraction people's normal lives disappeared and their attitiateds were altered to enjoy this event. Roadway Fatalities were decreased with the limitation of vehicular activities all around Bogota. In 1992 deaths due to traffic accidentes were reduced by about 50%. ""Traffic violence also dropped by almost 50 percent in Bogota... according to a spokesman, Jean-Paul Rasse, more than 1,100 citizens have been killed this year and over 30,000 iunjured - a slight drop from last... "" As said in an article in the New York Times.

More phycial fitness is achieved by decrease the use of cars. People in the col-de-saxoner area of the Swiss Alps had to come up with new plans to get to work, school, the store, etc. because of ""No Car day in the... area, undeveloped in the Swiss Alps, offering half-off on ski-lifts."" A 1, 492 foot altitude decrease happened in the self transport race. The bathroom is a very common place to get injured, also a lot of the time it's because of the slipping that occurs ususally when entering the tub. A greater chance of slipping occurs during car-to-bathroom travel, which happened only in France becasue of car-free day, people had to walk, or ride bikes to tMinMax.net they couldn't drive their cars. T-MinMax is known as WAlmart in France.

Limiting the use of cars has some advantages and desadvantages, preventing ""car to bathroom"" trips reduces the risk of injury, and decreasing the air pollution does a lot of things, such as making a city look new very few years. The amount of deaths by car accidents with limited car-use could be greatly reduced as well. Overall I believe this would be an amazing idea to put it to use throughout the world! It's a great way not only to make places look new again, but to also improve peoples effiecenty and effict, also to help the environment. I know I've seem some places and they honestly look horrible reven if they weren't, so it's just a first impression sort of thing. Reading these disadvantages wasn't a shocker at all I know cars are a very common source of air pollution and a big source of mortality and injury rates all around, it would help a large amount of places.",1
"Studying Venus can be dangerous but,there are some times where it's not dangerous. Venus is the second planet from the solar system. No spaceship has landed on Venus for decades. Venus is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Astronomers have been intreaged by Venus by looking like an Earth-like planet.

Venus was covered with oceans a long time ago. Venus has rocky sediment which are valleys,mountains,and craters. NASA has an idea by sending by sending humans to study Venus. Venus has a ground condition that is 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Air pressure in Venus is kinda close to the sea level on Earth.

Venus has a dense atmosphere and you can't see it with light. Researchers can't take samples of rock,gas,or anything else. Researchers see taking risks as challenges. Researchers are using machines to study Venus to know the knowledge of Venus. The machines are made out of silicon carbide.

The machines has lasted 3 weeks. NASA has another project called mechanical computers which is old technology. They're first envisioned in the 1800s. In the 1940s,it played an important role during World War ll. Those kinds of computers used to exist in those days.

In conclusion,its still ok to go to Venus. Venus has a lot of similarities to Earth. Venus is not dangerous. Even though it has hot temperature,its still good. Astronauts can go to Venus.",0
"Street racing is one of the most dangerous and increasingly popular activities young people can do. People who are involved in this type of activity put themselves and their community in a lot of danger. With many precautions it is true that happy and successful car racing can go on, but the risks of the successful race are too high and not worth it. Even carrying all of the proper safety gear hapens to be not enough, factors that can come into place with the track or cars people can't control. Car racing must be limited to people actually in the business of creating a sport for the skill, not the racers themselves creating a game of daredevil for himself or friends.",1
"The ""Unmasking of the Face on Mars"" is a natural landform. Just like most natural landforms the face is quite bigger than seen on pictures.. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte. The picture also shows something equivalent to a mesa. The Face seen on Mars is a natural landform because it looks similar to a butte, it looks similar to a mesa, and just like most natural landforms its quite big.

The Face of Mars looks quite similar to a butte. First of all, a butte is a landform more common around the American West. In the text someone sates,""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. Second of all, the Face is more simialr to a butte is becasue people could identify that they have seen something simialr to the Face. For example, in the text someone said that it looks similar to something that they have seen before. Lastly, the Face of Mars is just a landform that looks similar to some theat we have on Earth. A butte is more common on the west side of the U.S.

The Face of Mars looks similar to a mesa. First of all, a mesa is a landform which is more common around the American West. In the text someone states,"" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. Second of all, the Face couldn't have been created by aliens becasue people right away could identify the Face as something they have sen before. Lastly, Mars's ""face"" is just a landform the looks similar to a lava dome that most people are familiar with. For example, lava domes that take the form of an isolated mesa is what the Face can be identified as.

Just like any natural landform, most of them are quite big. First of all, the photo of the Face captured took up most of the frame, most natural landforms are not quite hard to miss. In the text is states,As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were! Second of all, ladforms aren't hard to miss. For example, in the text they explain that it was hard to take a picture because of cloud coverage. Just becasue the clouds coverd it doesn't mean that the clouds will clear, and i'm sure you could have seen it just not all of it. Lastly, When the picture was taken they said that each pixel was 1.56 meters instead of the 43 meters per pixel in the picture taken in 1976. Just becasue the meters per pixel is smaller doesn't indicatethat the landform is small. Seeing it on picture is way different then seeing it up close.

In conclusion, The Face of Mars is just an rdinary landform because it looks simialr to a butte, it looks simialr to a mesa, and most landforms are big and quite hard to miss. From reading this you now know that the Face of Mars is just a landform an not alian markings.",0
"The face phenomena has been seen all around the world and it's now happening in the U.S. I think that the face is fascinating and vines like ""Face of Jesus"" is real and it's just the face in the moutain is similar to God. There's other people around the world with faces in building like our world, so yes, I do agree that the face fascinated me and it other poeple too.

On pg. 626, the first article states ""Face of Terrorist and God Spotted in Twin Screws."" In 1997, the picture was taken of rusty, old screws in a fomrer less plant in France, which makes it seem like the place is haunted. The small rock face is now ""the last celebrity sighting of the millennium"". Which came out on January 1, 2000. You could tell that people were panicking also it was the last day of the second most hyped-up apocalypse of the second half of the millinum.

Continuing on Pg. 627, the second article states ""a Face in the Martian Cyrosphere."" It's discovered by the spacecraft Mariner 9. The ""Face on Mars"" became an icon of popular culture, appearing on T-Shirts and mugs, inspiring Halloween ""carved-Versions, etc. Up close with the red planet, Mars. You can tell that it's not a face at all.

On Pg. 628, ""Do You see a Face?"" Last paragraph.... ""In fact, your brain is also at work when you look at many other things you see daily, from clouds to cars to quesadillas."" Other people think it is the face of Jesus and soe others think it's a simple building on a hill. It's just how your brain processes things and how you view them.

Based on what the certain poeple said, like on Pg. 626, the first article, the face in France. People claimed it looks a lot like ""a certain local politician."" The same man whose beeen convicted for his part in the most infamous French political scandadel of modern times. They deserve to have a face but not to have their normal living become complicated.",1
"In my opinion, I don't think that you should use technology to read emotions for classes. I think that because the students should know whether someone is sad, happy, or angry even if it's hard to tell. They should not use technology to tell someone emotions, that means that they're going to use that technology more and more and it could either damage the future or probably fix the future but I think that they shouldn't use it. For people that can't tell how someone is feeling, it can be harderfor them to tell because even though that technology is in one class, it could be in any class and people that don't know how to tell emotions, it can get harder for them because all they can remember is looking at the computer and not looking at an actual person face figuring out how they feel. It shouldn't be in classes because it'll most likely cause problems for people who have trouble seeing emotions and causing peopleto use it more insread of looking at someone's face and saying that it's hard to tell either if they're sad or angry.

Technology is big nowadays, which mean more and more new inventions would come into the future. Yes, this invention can work pretty good but it can also cause problems. Just by looking at the muscles of the human face on a computer doesn't mean you can tell that one person is angry or happy, there's so many emotions in one person and you can guess angry but instead they're sad. I think that students in class that has this technology should look at people's faces and tell if they're sad or happy. The Mona Lisa is an amazing example, it's hard to tell if she's either mad or happy, and instead of using technology to figure that out, look at her face and see if she's either angry or happy.

If this technology is in every class, then student's would just guess based on that technology to see if someone is happy or sad. Student's should use paintings or pictures to tell that person emotions. I think that the only time to use that technology is to look at the face muscles and not just telling if someone is happy or sad. If someone that I know is sad would I use that technology? Absolutely not, I'll just look at their and see if they're sad or not. So my opinion on this is don't use it for people's emotions, use it to just look at the face muscles and describe what they are.",0
