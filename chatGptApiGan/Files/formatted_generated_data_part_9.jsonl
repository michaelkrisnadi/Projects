I think the author thinks studying Venus is worthy based of the author saying in Paragragh five althought it is 170\u00b0 F(Fahrenheit) it may be difficultt condtions, but it still survivable for humans.\n\nMore evidence of it being worthy of studying is in Paragragh seven saying NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. From one of there examples, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus\u0092s surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions, meaning it is possible to find research. Research is our only way of getting data proven in Paragragh six stating \"researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks\".\n\nAnd my final piece of evidance stating it is worthy of studying Venus is in Paragragh's six and eight \"peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\""}]}

This is easy to belive at first glance, but we decided to look further. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over this red planet. The MOC team took a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. This photo revealed a natural landform. This concluded that there was no alien monument on Mars.\n\nBut many theorists, like yourself, stayed unconvinced. Again on April 8, 2001 another photo was taken. This time the photo was taken by Malin's team, and they used the camera's maximum resloution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. This means that if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were. The image taken actually portrays a Martian version of a butte or mesa which are landforms common around the American West. \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.\" says Jim Gravin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program.\n\nThus, I state my response again: there was no astraterestrial life on Mars."}]}

However, people don't realize the damage they are causing when using cars or other transporting veichles.

According to Source 2., after several days or pollutuion Paris mandated a driving ban to clear the air of the global city and about 4,000 drivers were fined for not obeying the regulations.

The author describes the FACS or Facial Action Coding System as a technology to shows a recognition to facial movement. In today's society we know that its alot of emotions being shown throughout the world no matter what's the case is. For example, emotions are hidden by certain people or even people that don't show emotions at all. To support my claim is that no matter if parents or anybody tells them something they will not show any type of emotion any type of way, so they use equipment or something such as the FACS technology program.\n\nThe author says that from using the FACS experiment that it will make you feel sightly happy. In my opinion that is not true because that when you are down or upset you wouldn't want to do a experiment just to make you feel happy because you would think the experiment was nonsense. The author also provided us with is that if you raises your eyebrowns when your suprises and around your mouth tightens your lips to show anger is true because the FACS could shows and tell your emotion at anytime and any place.\n\nWhen looking at the Mona Lisa painting it was sucessful and was one of Leonardo da Vinci's biggest accomplishment was the painting of Mona Lisa. Some of the new comptuer software that can recognize emotions, It was sucessful because the software is the latest innovation from Professor Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advance Science at the University of Illinois with collaboration with Professor Nicu Sebe Of the University of Amsterdam.\n\nComparing school computer and FACS is that school computer can recognize if a students is bored , or even confused about a problem there doing on a website such as Mindplay, Khan Academy , Carnige Learning, and etc. The FACS is extermely helpful and useful is because the FACS materials can be expressive for video games or video surgery. It can also help with human communication that aew nonverbal including emotional communtication. By according to Dr. Huang notes he says \" So computers need to understand that too.\".\n\nYour home computer or work computer cannot modify Mona Lisa smile. To support my claim is in pargraph 7 it says \" Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. \" But you can write down some simple instructions that \"encode\" the different emotions.\n\nThe author says in Pargraph 9 us that the FACS can give you happy face that it can acutally be useful.\n\nIt can be false because a fake smile is when you mouth widen alittle bit with no teeth showing , and when using the FACS it can probably not show it.\n\nThe FACS technology can be very helpful for counselor, teachers , deans, doctors and even more. When someone is mentally challenge or mentally disabled the counsleor can uses the FACS to identify the mental person emotions. It can be helpful with teachers and deans is to identify the different or emotion the child has. For examples, say a child is got bully in the cafeteria for his lunch money and he just walks out the cafeteria with a frown on his face and he doesn't want to show his emotion toward the dean and/or teacher so thats when they can used the FACS technology to figure out there emotions.\n\nThe FACS is very helpful for humans that performs the same impressive \"calculation\" everyday. Of course, most of us can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look of there face , you can probably tell by the look of there faces when they are happy, sad, worried that why Lenardo da Vinci made the Mona Lisa picture and his crew from making the FACS technology. The author is giving us the mood of encouraging because without the FACS technology then we would never know how people feel when it comes down to the people that don't show emotions.\n\nIn conclusion , FACS is very useful in many different sceranio. If it wasnt for the FACS technology then we wouldn't know how kids,adults,students,teachers and etc feel. Another thing is that the FACS technology is very helpful because that it can tell if a student is bored , and/or even tired. While a regular computer can tell if the student is bored. I would reccomend this in schools,hostipals, doctors office , or even in the dentist area."}]}

At some point this technology may be helpful for counselors of schools but it is not for daily classroom use.\n\nI am not saying that this technology is not an innovation. It is a tremendous breakthrough to the world of technology. And it could be beneficial to some professions and aspects of life, like psychology, but it just does not apply to students in the same way. The author says \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor\".\n\nThis is not true.\n\nThe only way that this could be true is if we replaced human teachers with computers, and that, i think, is a huge step in the wrong direction.\n\nTechnology is helpful to the world but to much of it may be a problem that is irreversable.\n\nFurthermore, I think that this technology could be very helpful to high school counselors. With the emotional reader the counselors will be able to identify cases of depression or anxiety or other mental disorders found in high school easier.\n\nIn the article it states, \"we humans perform this same impressive \"calculation\" every day\". This is referring to the calculating the computer does. It says that we do that to which is true but we are not nearly as precise or efficient. That is why we need this technology or something like it for counselors, to lighten their burdens, but to also ensure that their job gets done.\n\nFinally, I believe that the installation of emotionally sensing computers to every classroom would be a mistake. However, putting them in the hands of counselors would be brilliant. I think that the world should look into this technology more and decide the best uses for it."}]}

They ask \"Why would I reduce my use of something that gets me to my desired destination the fastest?\" Despite the fact that cars appear to be more conveinient, the harm they do to the Earth far outweighs the benefits. Cars have become more and more prevelant in the entire world since World War II, as society has been built around the car and its ease of use. This unremitting usage of the car has resulted in a shocking amount of pollution to the Earth. The reduction of car usage is advantageous to the environment. Cars produce so much pollution, have a gradual decuction in use would have possitive effects on the environment.\n\nThe greatest advantage of limiting car usage is the positive effects it would have on the environment. It is common knowldge that the Earth is in a state of self-destruction, with humans pouring in incredible amounts of greenhouse gases into it. A high percentage of these harmuful emissions come from cars and other gas-powered vehicles. If car usage was limited, a much healthier Earth would result. According to the article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" passenger cars were responsible for 12 percent of grenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and nearly 50 percent in highly congested cities across the\u00a0 United States. With this in mind, cutting these numbers down, even if only in half, would bring about such prosperity to the environemnt that benefits would soon be noticed. These figures show that the reduction of car usage is pivotal in the fight to protect the environment. Also in the article \"Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog\" it is said that car usage became so heavy in Paris that it developed insane amounts of smog, rivaling that of Beijing, which is one of the most polluted cities in the world. Clearly the root of the problem for Paris was the abundance of car usage, which once limited, reduced the smog greatly. This proves that cars can be a huge problem for the environment, but limiting the usage will have near immediate benefits. Again the environmental benefit of limiting car use is seen in the article \"The End of Car Culture.\" The article states that a limit to car usage would \"have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's eissions.\" This article does not only say that cars are\u00a0 large part of pollution, but it also directly claims that less usage would be good for the environment. Limiting car usage is very important to maintaining the Earth as it is now. It is gradually becoming more and more polluted, and the limiting of vehicle use can stop that.\n\nDespite the convenience of the car, it is such a harm to the enironment that its limiting of usage is absolutely neccesary. Several exmaples point out that cars are one of the biggest means of pollution, as it seems everyone is always drving them. Limiting car usage is one of the best things that can be done to save the environement. It is obvious that the preservation of our planet is far more important than the convenience of turning a five minute walk into a short one minute trip. With the ecological benefits of the limit of car usage, this limit of usage is defnitly advantageous."}]}

The picture also shows something equivalent to a mesa. The Face seen on Mars is a natural landform because it looks similar to a butte, it looks similar to a mesa, and just like most natural landforms its quite big.\n\nThe Face of Mars looks quite similar to a butte. First of all, a butte is a landform more common around the American West. In the text someone sates,\"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,\" says Garvin. Second of all, the Face is more simialr to a butte is becasue people could identify that they have seen something simialr to the Face. For example, in the text someone said that it looks similar to something that they have seen before. Lastly, the Face of Mars is just a landform that looks similar to some theat we have on Earth. A butte is more common on the west side of the U.S.\n\nThe Face of Mars looks similar to a mesa. First of all, a mesa is a landform which is more common around the American West. In the text someone states,\" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. Second of all, the Face couldn't have been created by aliens becasue people right away could identify the Face as something they have sen before. Lastly, Mars's \"face\" is just a landform the looks similar to a lava dome that most people are familiar with. For example, lava domes that take the form of an isolated mesa is what the Face can be identified as.\n\nJust like any natural landform, most of them are quite big. First of all, the photo of the Face captured took up most of the frame, most natural landforms are not quite hard to miss. In the text is states,\u0093As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,\u0094 he added. \u0093So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\u0094 Second of all, ladforms aren't hard to miss. For example, in the text they explain that it was hard to take a picture because of cloud coverage. Just becasue the clouds coverd it doesn't mean that the clouds will clear, and i'm sure you could have seen it just not all of it. Lastly, When the picture was taken they said that each pixel was 1.56 meters instead of the 43 meters per pixel in the picture taken in 1976. Just becasue the meters per pixel is smaller doesn't indicatethat the landform is small. Seeing it on picture is way different then seeing it up close.\n\nIn conclusion, The Face of Mars is just an rdinary landform because it looks simialr to a butte, it looks simialr to a mesa, and most landforms are big and quite hard to miss. From reading this you now know that the Face of Mars is just a landform an not alian markings."}]}

I think that because the students should know whether someone is sad, happy, or angry even if it's hard to tell. They should not use technology to tell someone emotions, that means that they're going to use that technology more and more and it could either damage the future or probably fix the future but I think that they shouldn't use it. For people that can't tell how someone is feeling, it can be harderfor them to tell because even though that technology is in one class, it could be in any class and people that don't know how to tell emotions, it can get harder for them because all they can remember is looking at the computer and not looking at an actual person face figuring out how they feel. It shouldn't be in classes because it'll most likely cause problems for people who have trouble seeing emotions and causing peopleto use it more insread of looking at someone's face and saying that it's hard to tell either if they're sad or angry.\n\nTechnology is big nowadays, which mean more and more new inventions would come into the future. Yes, this invention can work pretty good but it can also cause problems. Just by looking at the muscles of the human face on a computer doesn't mean you can tell that one person is angry or happy, there's so many emotions in one person and you can guess angry but instead they're sad. I think that students in class that has this technology should look at people's faces and tell if they're sad or happy. The Mona Lisa is an amazing example, it's hard to tell if she's either mad or happy, and instead of using technology to figure that out, look at her face and see if she's either angry or happy.\n\nIf this technology is in every class, then student's would just guess based on that technology to see if someone is happy or sad. Student's should use paintings or pictures to tell that person emotions. I think that the only time to use that technology is to look at the face muscles and not just telling if someone is happy or sad. If someone that I know is sad would I use that technology? Absolutely not, I'll just look at their and see if they're sad or not. So my opinion on this is don't use it for people's emotions, use it to just look at the face muscles and describe what they are."}]}
