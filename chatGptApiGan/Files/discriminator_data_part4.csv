"I am just going to run to the store to get some stuff to make dinner tonight before the snow storm comes.I but the bread i needed justine serrano making spaghetti and garlic bread for me and my son. All of a sudden i looked outside and these big, white, unwanted, dangerous snow flakes started to come out. I was not happy at all. It was not time for snow, i had things to do and places to be and this snow was not going to make it happen. I was in a big rush and just wanted to hurry up and get out of the store and get home. While i was waiting in line a costumer had the nerve to speak up and explain to everyone that i was in a hurry to go home and cook dinner for me and my son. I ended up pissing me off more because it was true and then i relized that it was probley because it was all my fault! But anyways got the stuff and came home. I made the spaghetti and the garlic bread and me and my son both ate. i did end up going outside and attempted to get my car out but that did not work to keep warm and play in the snow with my neighbors kids but i told her she could not go to the store because she did not have any pants on because she is only 3 but it is whatever. these was my day and my dinner. i hope the snow is gone in the morning because i have my son a doctrs appointment that i have been waiting on and i have to take him to the morning tutoring. he really needs it because that poor baby is hungry for knowlege! the end of my snow storm day.",1
"The story ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" Main purpuse was to in form us of the stugles of trying to find a whay to get humons on Venus, Then giving us informashon of why its so hard to find a whay to live on Venus, for example Its eghat hunders degrees Farenheit, and that the presher is ninedy times more preshere than are planet. Then give us some examples of how there testing on how to live on Venus by tresing things at the bottom of the ocecn.

The main reason why they are doing this is, because Venus is the most like planet to earth in are soilersiston, so if we need to we can go thare to live if the earth is going to be distored.

So with this informashon I can conculed that this arical is to infrom us of what is going on with space trave in the fucher.",0
"Euthanasia is a controversial issue in our society today. Many believe it goes against a person's religious beliefs and takes away one's right to their very own life. Others say that it's a humane way to end on going suffering. My HUMAN thesis is the debate over whether euthanasia should be legalized in the united states is politically fueled, the second the issue is put on a ballot the passionate anti euthanasia advocates will gather support making it almost impossible to pass all four of the necessary hurdles, and that the people of america are significantly divided over this issue it does not strictly follow party or religious lines.

My first HUMAN argument states that the debate over whether euthanasia should be legalized in this country is politically fueled. Looking at the lines of support for both the pro euthanasia and anti euthanasia movements it is clear that party lines are not the only influential factor at play. Both line one (Republicans strongly oppose) and line three (Democrats strongly support) follow fairly consistent lines however line 2 (Republicans tend to agree with) and line four (Democrats tend to agree with) stray away from what would be expected. In order to completely answer the question of why euthanasia has the support that it does we must also look at religious influences.

Once the issue of euthanasia is put on a ballot it becomes very difficult to pass all four of the necessary hurdules in FINAL. Firstly, the pro euthanasia movement must be able to gather the necessary amount of signatures in order to be put on a ballot. The constitutions of Calofornia, Michigan, Oregon, massachusetts, and Washington all require the initiative process in order for a pro euthanasia measure to have a chance. The signiture gathering stage drags the already difficult process of passing these laws out over an extended amount of time. Euthanasia advocates of the right to advocate to die also missed there 1996 deadline for colleccting signatures; the measure is now on the back burner. Next, lets assume that the proponents to make it past this stage to actually get the measure to a vote in the first place.

The paeansvill oregon campaign in 92 did make it to the ballot where it was the first pro euthanasia measure to by put to a popular vote in the U.S. Voters in paeansill rejected the proposed law by a margin of 54 percent to 46 percent, and perderson lossed his effort to expand oregons law the following year. The NO to 119 campain also gathered of the necessary signatures to get in on the ballot, but in october the organization that was filed with running the campaige folded because it did not of enoough money to continue. Finally, lets examine the oregon statute. In order to pass an initiative in oregon there must be affirmative support from a majorit of voters, and the margin of victory must be no less than 2 percent of the total votes case at the election. In the 1994 clack sky of oregon case the supporters of the death with dignity act suffers defeat when initial results for a 7,939-vote margin began to shrink to about 5,000 votes. It finaly showed a 34,000 vote margin of victory, but initiatve supporters were not able to shrink it even more again the vote took place on november 3; the results were not finally ofical until eight days later.",1
"Should Drivers Be Able to Use Cell Phones While Driving?

""The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving."" Drivers shouldn't be able to use their phones while driving because it creates a distraction that could not only lead to injury to the person on their phone but also other innocent drivers on the road. Even the most experienced drivers can find themselves losing control of the wheel while concentrating on their phones. Also driving is a task that requires constant awareness, any type of diversion can lead to accidents no matter how quick it is. In a lot of cases death and serious injury is the result of ""glancing"" at your phone even for two seconds. In reality no text, call, video, etc is worth losing a life over.

Additionally the mortality rate behind using cellphones while driving has caused some states to take legal action. 19 states have banned hand-held cell phone usage while diving, 39 states bans any cell phone usage for novice drivers, 20 states bans any cell phone usage for school buses and 48 states have banned texting while driving. So not only is cell phone usage while driving dangerous but also illegal. So if you are using a cellphone you risk getting into an accident and getting into trouble with the law, which could possibly require jail time or a fine. Also this can affect your insurance, constant tickets and fines from texting while driving can make your insurance go up almost two times its original cost.

According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause car accidents. Studies show that using a cell phone can make you 4x more likely to crash. Despite the dangers, people still use their cell phones while driving to communicate or occupy themselves. Some may argue that using hands-free features is safe, but research shows it can be just as dangerous as holding the phone because the conversation can distract drivers from the road. Distracted drivers have a slower reaction time meaning in case of an emergency where they need to make a quick move they won't be able to. Having that quick extinct when you're not distracted could make the difference between life and death.

Although people may say ""It was just a one time thing, I barely text while driving."" Science begs a differ, during recent years it has been studied that texting while driving has become a huge epidemic. Scientist have even compared it to craving junk food, stating that like junk food we crave being on our phones. Study shows that the average person check their phone once every 12 minutes and 80 times a day. So using your phone while driving can definitely become a habit even if you just do it a ""couple times"".

In conclusion, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people's responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives. Putting up your cell phone and waiting until you're at a stable place can save your life. No one should put themselves or others at risk to reply to a text message. Even if you're hands-free it can still distract you on the road and make you unable to make detrimental last minute decisions.

Everyone should be mindful of everyone and themselves and focus only on driving when their on the road.",0
"Cell phones are not safe to use while driving. People act like they need to answer or get to there phone to be safe on the road. They are wrong, everybody should know that tryin to reply or read a text message takes their eyes, hand, and at least some bit of their attention away from the road. Even havinjust one hand on the wheel is bad enough for some people who just started drivin. If that is them, then they might end up swervin off the road or into another car. Are they keepin themselves safe, no. The people that they run off the road or hit with their car will be the ones who suffer too, possibly even the ones who dies. If people will stop usin their phone while drivin, then they will be keepin lots of people safe.",1
"Chaos on Venus? Venus is one the hottest planets in our solar system and the most dangerous planet to explore. The author beleives that trying to explore Venus isn't worth it despite all the dangers in presents. Venus isn't safe for humans to explore. Our mechines wouldn't be much help to explore Venus. Even if we get humans close to Venus, they would still to get close enough to take simples.

Venus isn't safe for humans. Venus is to hot for humans to vist and is constantly expericencing natural dangers. In paragraph 3 it states that,"" Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like eruping volcanoes, powerful earth quakes, and frequent lightning strkes to probes seeking on its surface."" This shows that Venus is safe for humans.

Our mechines wouldn't be much help againist the dangers of Venus. Because of the atmosphere pressure, most thing would just get destroyed or crushed. In the paragraph 3 it states that,""the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet .These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" The proves that our mechines wouldn't be much help.

Even if we can get humans to Venus safey, they would still have to get close to surface to takes samples and there are risk to getting closer to surface. In paragraph 6 it states that,"" However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most form of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard froms of photography and videography ineffective. more importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a through miss to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk."" These are all good example as to why visting Venus would be worthless and how humans would have to get close enough to Venus to take some type of sample.

In conclusion, visting isn't safe for humans. Mechines would be much help exploring Venus. Even if humans got to Venus it wouldn't make a difference to the risk and dangers of being on Venus. There for studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.",0

"What would it be like without cars? Well acording to the passages there are a lot of cities that are trying this car free world. The one city that are free of cars is Vauban,Germany. So lets see how they like the car free communtiy.

The frist place were looking at is Vauban,Gremany. they have a total car free rule. they cant have car in the town . but if they have to park them they have to buy a space for $40,000 along with a house. As a result 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars.57 percent sold a car to move here. Vauban completed inn 2006 , Is a example of a growing trend in Europe, The united states and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use. As a componet of a movement called ""smart planning"".

"In Saddam hussein's reign of power of iraq as a military officer, twarted all attemps to over throw him and his control over iraq, and still held power till he was captured in 2003. Hussein has held his rank of power for numbers of years and he likes it this way and doesnt want it to change, so he has troops to protect him, what ever the risks take. Cental intelligence aengcy troops have been on a look out to capture and bring in hussein because he's been accused of having weapons of mass destruction still while in hiding. They continue to hunt, till monday december 13, 2003, when a tip from a us trooper is recieved that hussein has been eating his terrible last serval years in hiding, at a given home near his hometown of tikrit, iraq.

"On May 21, 2016, Christina Mays had been told by her doctor, that she would be expecting her first child. Excited and anxious she decided to text her husband the good news. David Mays was delighted about the news and responded with a sweet message. It is not clear whether Christina saw that sweet message before her car slammed into the back of a truck while merging onto the highway. From the lack of response, David became worried. He attempted to call Christina and left several messages requesting to hear her beautiful voice. But to no avail he could not reach her. David knew something horrible had happened. Christina, a beautiful twenty-year-old was dead. Police ultimately deemed texting the cause of her fatal car crash.

Although the police found evidence that texting and driving caused her untimely death; the likelihood of a car crash increases drastically with the occurrence of distracted driving.

Distracted driving occurs anytime a driver takes their eyes off the road, hands off the wheel or sometimes just simply being a teen carrying too many passengers.

Distracted driving is a huge problem, although it is not due to cell phones alone, they are a huge contributor. Taking your eyes off the road, even for a second, can be risky. Because operating a cellphone takes the drivers attention off the road, long enough for them to veer into other lanes of on-coming traffic. Because of this, it only takes a split second for this type of distracted driving to become a fatality. For this reason, it is necessary for drivers to focus on driving only and leave their cellphones in their pockets.

Secondly, text messaging requires you to visually and manually use sometimes both of your hands; it is by far the most frightening distraction used by not just teens, but adults as well. Most vehicles are considered a weapon. Consequently, they can cause extreme damages during a crash. This is why it is never safe to take your hands off the wheel, even to answer a call. As a result of this, some states have chosen to pass laws prohibiting motorist form using their cellular devices while operating a motor vehicle.

Lastly, most of us realize that social media rules the land. In this day in age, if it's not recorded it didn't happen. Seeing that teen drivers lack experience while driving. Consequently, means that they require more focus than experienced drivers. Therefore, carrying too many passengers while trying to operate a cellphone is hazardous to all parties involved, including innocent bystanders. Studies have shown that too many passengers can be a huge distraction, especially while using a cell phone.

In conclusion, texting and any type of distracted driving seems to be a social issue and will possibly take individuals awhile to change or completely stop. Hopefully people will understand sooner than later, that multitasking while driving is dangerous for all.",0
"Some historians believe that law enforcement is a science. One day is valley montis is saying that law enforcement is a science because there really is not a steady pattern. Helen speir is saying that his many speedy retrial are possible becayse police dis not collect all of the facts, and detectives have gotten very good at putting cases against individuals who deseves being in jail. Prosecutors have to make sure that there is reasonable doubt after the judge decides if there is enough evidence to go to trial. One day in williamsburg, virginia after gavin lee and his cousin, cyril williams found somevery old bones along the edge of a construction site. Besides science another huge reason to why law enforcemnet is not a science is becuase of human error. All of these report says that lawenforcement should not be counted as a science because there is not a correct a steady pattern. Another reason is because of freud biases becasue you may think the evidence supports you but it may not and officers can only look for crime in a certain ways.",1
"Everyone nowadays is so used to driving a car here and there even if it would just be five minutes on foot, but what if you started limiting your car usuage? Making your feet be your gas instead of a pump when the distance is close enough, and even biking occasionally. Limiting car usuage may sound like a bad thing, but it has many advangtages such as reducing pollutin, increasing saftety for human beings, and even opeing options for alternative transportion.

Cars release a great amount of polluants into the air increasing smog in some areas worse than others, like in Paris, China, and other places. Providing or opening your mind to other ways to get from one destination to the next, would reduce the smog thats in the air. This simple action as close to 70% of the population pitching in can result in a healthier environment, and some people may agree with Heidurn Walter. She says ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way."" Not only that, people who do not agree or get rid of their transportion vechicles will be fined. For example, in Germany you have to pay $40,000 if you want to get a car owner space and this does not include the money you have to spend on your house. Than, in Paris 4,000 drivers were fined $31 dollars after not leaving their cars home after a public annocement was made to do so. This shows that opening this can increase health, or make an environment cleanier. Plus, you actually inforcing something that is good for the environment will get people to participate, such as a fine.

Hearing engines roar and cars zoom pace is a sound all too familar with citizens who walk or ride constantly. It can be quite on the thrilling side crossing the streets or even walking down a busy rode when you know being hit is a possibly. Limiting car usage can decrease the risks or heavy weighted vechicles hitting biking, or walking citizens that dont have a chance against the weight. This increases saftety, bumping into another human or being nugded by a bike wont affect your body as much as a 500 pound or even heavier car crashing into a 100 pound person. Like, Carlos Arturo said ""It's a good opportuinity to take away stress..."" meaning the stess that comes with a car. The money for gas and the risk or hitting someone or being hit is taken away when on foot or on bike. This shows limting car usage isnt only increasing the safety or people walking or biking, it also takes away stess factors like money, fixing a car if it needs repair, and other factors.

Finally, having alternate forms of transportion can open your eyes to a whole need world. Instead of constanly beiong locked in your 4 door honda prison or your house you're outside seeing new people and increasing social interaction. Not only this, but you're getting excerise and maintaining your health or builing it. Which is another reason to limit the amount we use our cars. This shows that doing so can not only increase saftery, and money, but health and social oppurtunitys.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has many advangtages even if you dont realize it and our soiciety could benefit a lot from it. Like, when it comes to the safety of the next generation, the present, or the previous. Than, it can even take away stress that come with a vechicle and even increase health and social gathering.",0
"In recent years, many industries have embraced the idea of using robots to complete everyday tasks for humans. However, some argue that this is not a good thing at all. They argue that finding new things for humans is better because it increases our intellectual./ creative ability. They also argue that using robots in everyday life is overusing their ability and can be a waste of time and money. The truth is, there is no right answer to this question. Using robots is necessary for us as humans, but too much usage can limit our creativity. We need to find some way to continue using robots while instilling creativity in the human minds.

Within the novel ""Feed"", by M.T. Anderson, excessive usage of the ""feed"" has limited the thinking capacity, creativity, and intellectual ability of the human brain. Anderson displays this through the main protagonist, Titus, through his choices, his thoughts, and his actions. Anderson does a phenomenal job of illustrating that choosing the easy way by becoming dependent on anything can negatively affect humans. The idea and the importance of not becoming dependent on technology is one displayed by Anderson in a futuristic society doomed by its own tendencies.

As humans, we need to be aware that depending on anything can and does have consequences. Although the ""feed"" may benefit us, feed safety does not come guaranteed. In ""Feed"" by Matthew Tobin Anderson, Titus and Violet both suffer the real-world consequences to a dependency on the ""feed"". As we indulge in what technology has to offer, we must be aware, but also be wise and know when to get off line.",1
"Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions (Rosenthal 34). Global warming is becoming more of an issue as time goes on,  part of this problem is vehicles and their pollution they let off. People are getting more and more worried about this as temperatures continue to rise on Earth. They are trying to do something about it. One of the more popular suggestions to help solve the issue is to limit car usage. I know, it seems pretty bizare due to the fact that some towns, such as my own, do not have everything citizens need within a walking distance. Benefically, ""stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.(Rosenthal 6)"". It is thought that it will ""drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States (Rosenthal 5)"". People also are not putting forth an effort to help decrease the pollution by buying hybrids, instead they buy Diesels. Diesel gas has more pollutants then regular gasoline.

Safety is another reason to reduce car usage. Think about it, if pedestrians reduced their car usage by 50 percent the percentage of car accidents would also decrease. This could save many people's lives; animals as well. Rosenthal said, ""Cities could become denser, and better for walking"", which also makes it safer. To go along with saving lives lets mention health. Americans are getting more and more unhealthy and overweight. It is a rising problem in our country. Many people die from it everyday; obesity can be stopped. One way to lose weight and get in shape is exercise. Imagine how much better shape Americans would be in if we actually had to walk to the grocery store or McDonald's. It would make us think ""do we really need that?"". Those extra burned calories count, sitting in a car does not burn many calories.

Traffic jams are aggravating to most people, with the decreasing number of car owners time is being saved. There is less traffic. Andrew Selsky studied car-free day in Bogota, and he stated ""rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic(28)"", this means time is being saved and people are getting to their destinations faster. Another idea was said by Carlos Arturo Plaza ""it's a good opprotunity to take away stress...(Selsky 24)"". Congestion stresses everyone out, whether running on time, running late or just taking a leisurely drive. It makes everyone stress. Congestion actually decreased 60 percent in Paris (Duffer 14). Heidrun Walter also said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.""

Limiting car usage helps a number of problems throughout the globe, such as to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, improve safety, and even improve your health (Rosenthal 43). You may wonder what other ways are there for you transport to the places you need to go. You could walk, jog, hike, bike, skate, or take public transportation. There are so many options and you have the opprotunity to meet new people and exercise if you're having a busy day. America should try it out just for a day and see what it leads to.",0
"Sporting events are always a microcosm of the world. The great events that happened in 2013 definitely mirrored the world. In many of the major sports such as football, basketball, and many others the sports worlds showed many great rivalries throughout the year. In addition to many great rivalries one of the greatest moments of the year was when Jason Dufner won his first major championship in golf.

The Auburn and Alabama rivalry is undoubtly one of the biggest rivalries in not just the state of Alabama, but in all of college football. The two teams had a meeting in november where the game came down to one of the most shocking endings in football history. Alabama attempted a 57 yard field goal with just one second remaining, however, the kick fell short of the uprights and Auburn's Chris Davis caught the kick in the back right corner of the endzone. Davis then ran the ball from field goal range into the opposite endzone to give Auburn the victory. It is certainly fair to say that this rivalry game ended in a huge play.

In December the world of soccer saw one of the greatest rivalries of all-time compete in a game. The two teams in the game were Spain and Brazil, and the game was a re-match of the previous game. The game was certainly a huge game internationally, and the winner of the game would become the Free Cup champion. Spain and Brazil have both been very strong soccer teams for the past decade, but Spain has been the powerHouse. However, Brazil defeated Spain 3-0 in the game to end their dominance of international soccer. The Bronaldos showed that they are definetly still a powerful international duo, and their individual growth as both soccer players and persons is certainly a microcosm of what the world is all about.

Although many great rivalry games happened during the year, Jason Dufners win in the US Open was certainly the highlight of the year. Dufner had never before won a major championship-winning the US Open was the greatest moment of his golfing career, and he finally broke through in 2013. The US Open is one of the four major championships in golf, and with his win Dufner became just the 13th man to ever win this golf tournament. Dufner definitely worked past a lot of adversity during his weekend, and winning the US Open was the perfect growth opportunity for him. That is the reason that Jason Dufners win was one of the greatest moments of 2013. All of the great sporting events that took place throughout the year were definitely full of many great rivalries. However, Jason Dufners win in the 2013 US Open golf tournament was certainly the highlight of the past year.",1
"Phones and Driving

In these times, phones are a huge distraction while on the road of driving. A Georgia law was made that drivers are to have a phone holder while driving in the vehicle, but there is still a large abundance of deaths in due to car accidents. According to research conducted at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away their phone while driving outweigh any drawbacks. In my opinion, I believe that phones should not be allowed of use during driving because it is inconsiderate of other drivers, it is illegal, it increases the number of deaths per year, and because it's a myth of multitasking while driving.

One reason I believe that phones should not be allowed of use during driving because it increases the number of deaths per year. For example, cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. Distracted driving is dangerous, and cell phone use while driving is a major factor. In 2018 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving was involved in 2,841 motor vehicle crash fatalities. Among those killed: 1,730 drivers, 605 passengers, 400 pedestrians and 77 bicyclists. Knowing cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help people manage a dangerous crash risk. Though texting and driving caused many injuries and deaths, there are still people who don't think it's a problem and are confident that they can use their phone and drive simultaneously. However, 34% of teens aged sixteen to seventeen spend about 10% of their driving time outside of their lane. This affects other people who are driving and can cause the deaths of innocent lives.

Another reason I believe that phones should not be allowed of use during driving because it is inconsiderate of other drivers. The consciousness of events happening around vehicle has a huge impact on driving. It is necessary for the drivers to monitor outside events and their possible impacts on driving. Using cell phones make it difficult to keep an eye on the outside events. Negligent behavior is highly immoral and unethical as it exposes human lives to a huge threat of accidents that could ultimately lead even to death. Now, a new study indicates that damn near everybody uses their phone while behind the wheel, damn near all the time. Using sensor data from more than 3 million drivers and 5.6 billion miles of trips, driving analytics company Zendrive found drivers are using their phones on 88 percent of their journeys. The average driver spends 3.5 minutes on the phone per hour trip, a stat that sounds worse when you realize just a two-second distraction increases your risk of crashing by 20 percent.

The last reason I believe that phones should not be allowed of use during driving because it's a myth of multitasking while driving. Multitasking is valued in today's culture, and our drive for increased productivity makes it tempting to use cell phones while behind the wheel. People often think they are effectively accomplishing two tasks at the same time. And yes, they may complete a phone conversation while they drive and arrive at their destination without incident, thus accomplishing two tasks during the same time frame.",0
"There are many different animals in the world that some people do not know about. They come in all shapes, sizes, and colors. One of the groups of animals that people do not know a lot about are sea cucumbers. Sea cucumbers are warty-bottomed creatures. They can be long and narrow or big and as big as a can of soda. They also have many different patterns and colors. Sea cucumbers have live all over the sea floor. They live all over the world accept for the higher latitudes. They even live in sand, coral reefs, seagrass, under rocks, and even in-between little grains of sand. These creatures feed off of stereo and bacteria or particles in sand. They can feed for about two hours, after that they just lie there motionless. They can even eat with bubbles. They take in water into the mouth, blocks off the water by using their tentacles, squirt the water out, then eat the particles with a mouth. No matter there has been different types of eating each species has a different type of plan of attack. Some sea cucumbers eat floating particles, while other eat whatever stays on the sea floor. Some even swim in order to find food. There are even a few that swim all of their adult lives. They are even a few that live a little longer then other. Some living up to 30 years. They go where the water carries and have no struggle to eat wherever they are taken.

This high-quality essay well explains sea cucumbers. They go in depth about where they live, how they eat, and the different types and colors. The author also give lots of different examples to go aloing with the inromation, like telling how long they gain eat for, what and who they gain eat, giving examples of how some search for food, and even giving examples of how long a few tube-like animals can live. DNA barcoding is and its purpose is to tell apart any type of living organism by using its DNA. It can be used whenever and wherever you want to use it and it will never fail you. The purpuse for using it is to better understand the structure of DNA and to also figure out how their is so many different creatures alike. The author also tells us how this idea came to life and how scientists began to figure out how it works. This author then gives a few example of how it can be used and why. So whenever anyone want to tell apart and two organisms whether they are plants, animals, or even inhrsects, they can always use this cours to do so.

This essay explains DNA barcoding and its purpose in great detail. It talkes about the benefits of it and the reason for using it in our world today. The author even goes into detail about the DNA and how its benefits us and how useful tt can be. They also tells why and how it all began and gives a few examples to go along with every last one of the author's ponts. This is a well organize high-quality piece of writing that was so interesting that I did not stop to take a breath while reading it.",1
"The advantages of limiting car usage is that many people needs a car for certain reasons and some may not because they would rather walk, take the bus, or may ride their bikes. Having a car may come in handy to some people because they are organize to have summer jobs and have social life around where they can walk and take public transportation or may even car pool with friends. People who do live in cities often take the bus, walk, and cabs if needed to.

Not all have cars in big cities because it cost more for gas and some probably can't drive. Since driving is becoming more big in life more teenagers and young adults are driving more often. Living in the suburbs you'll will need to drive because everything isn't close by each other it's more distance so maybe you'll probably have to walk or may ride a bike to get where your trying to go.

""With all these changes people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habbit.""  Well because they may feel that having something to do with a car may cost them alot. Not alot of people can afford cars and what the car needs for it to work properly instuff. People who did have a car were always intense because they never knew what can happen with the car.

Transportantion for America is a fast growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States. They want people in the community that live in the suburbs to pay more because using a car cost more than living in cities in that when your living in the cities you really wouldn't have that much to do because it's walking distance.

If your living on an island you probably wouldn't need a car that much because everything is like near or to close. Having a car on a island isn't really much needed to be honest you would barely use it which would be a waste of money for half of the stuff you may use to get on the car.",0
"The place I like to relax is Dillon Beach , California. The beach is not to crowded it is very quiet and peaceful. The waves are not rough, they are calm, it is a great place to swim. They have an abundance of seashells and it is near by a campsite . The kids have a great time on the beach ,and there are surfers but their are in desolate areas in the water. It is a great place to go fishing you catch a lot of things if you go about 7:00 in the morning. The fish do bite off the hook so be carefu. That is why i like to relax at Dillon Beach in California .

"In my personal opinion, I believe a computer that can read a humans's emotions by just the picture on their face, would be a great idea for children. "" A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" that detail would be exstreamly valuble, if it became real in the future. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor"". Can you imagine of how student problems can solved, now with this new piece of technology?

However, a good side may also have bad side. Technology is still growing and becoming more useful then ever, we use techology everywhere, for daily life plans,communicating,playing games even shopping. With those pros, come with cons, technology also has become a tool for unkindness like cyber bullying, not only that. But sick minded people, who find ways to spy on others inside their private homes through their computer cameras. Yes, their are simple remedies, like put your computer away with the top down, or when your on soical media. Don't give friends your password or post anything you know would be harmful, so a perosn can hack into it, connect to wifi's that don't allow EVERYONE to connect to them, because (it does'nt happen all the time) a person with the right system can see what your doing on your phone.

In a conclusion, my point is now, that scientists want computers to

""'calculate' emotions"" . Hackers COULD find a stronger way, to make things dangerouse for people by reading their emotions through the person's private computer (unless this idea only stay in school sytems). Now, I know I may sound paraniod or even carzy, but if we're honest technology is scary. Not saying we should never use it or through it away, of course not ,it's become people's life blood now, we it for everything. More over, it's the people behind the techonogy that do the harm. Not the technology itself. I just really don't want to give more unkind people a better chance of physicaly or emtionaly hurting someone.

At the end of the day, I just don't want to give more unkind people like bullies,hackers and others be given a better chance of physiaclly or emitonaly hurting someone. It's great if scientists to come up with new ways to save people through techonogy, reading a perosn's emotions can fix things and not just for children but young adults, adults the elderly .Even people with specal dissablities, if their being tested, a computer can tell if they understand through the emitionals they give infront of the computer. I just want it to have a postive effact rather then a negitve one.",0
