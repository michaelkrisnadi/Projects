"As a resident of the Bahamas, one must consider the fact that the Bahamas is susceptible to hurricanes, which is a natural disaster cannot be stopped by people. Although hurricanes devastate residents each year, there are advantages to living in the Bahamas, such as the breathtaking scenery, the friendly locals, the beautiful water, the government's response time to natural disasters, and how the government helps the residents after a natural disaster.

The Bahamas is known for being the most beautiful place on the earth, with beaches and breathtaking scenery. A day on the beach in the Bahamas is not like a day on the beach in America; it is more private and peaceful. Also, the color of the Bahamian water is the first feature that catches an American's attention because it is more blue. There is also a taste to the water, but it is not salty, it has more of a flavor.

Another advantage of living in the Bahamas is that the Bahamian citizens are very welcoming and friendly to the American residents. There is a number of people who moved to the Bahamas after receiving a warm welcome. Also, there is a type of ethnic mixture of people that adds a different flavor to the Bahamas. This ethnic mingling is very intriguing because there is always something to talk about and something to focus on.

The 1st type of treasure in the Bahamas is in the beautiful scenery. The second is in Bahamian residents themselves. The 3rd and final thing that the Bahamian citizens use to their advantage is the Bahamian government. One American witness said that ""the difference between the U.S. and the Bahamas, though, is the people and the government. In the U.S., politicians always promise they will help, but they rarely act."". People can learn from this statement because in the Bahamas a politician's word means everything, which means that a fake promise is equivalent to false hope. This also means that if the person cannot come through on a promise, then they should have never promised the thing in the first place; Bahamian politicians operate following this creed.

Though the Bahamian government acts on promises, the rule is that no politician or person is ever perfect. These people do make mistakes, although that does not stop them. The Bahamian people brush off and keep going after a mistake has been made, that is just how they operate. They lose sight of the material things and the things that do not truly matter, and they focus on what is truly clear.

These are advantages of living in The Bahamas. Though there are risks in living in there, the people of the Bahamas band together to overcome the obstacles that lie in their paths.

Sophomore Sparknotes, Inc., SPARKNEWS expeditions and SPARKSCHOOL exist as expenses unlike any other. They are unique in the fact that the are full of experiences and of sometime dreadful life-threating actions, as they are full of beauty, the absolitius beauty in the lesson or lesosn that will be discovered.

"Have we seen any form of life on Mars so far? No, that's why it's clearly a natural landform. Plus, how do the aliens know what we look like. They could look completely different from us. It just so happens that the natural landform look's like a face.

Why would the aliens spend their time making a two mile long face anyways? These natural landform's are common in Cydonia, only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoh. It is indeed interesting and cool to think that it was built by aliens, but it wasn't built by aliens. Don't get me wrong, everyone wishes it was made by aliens, but facts are facts.

In 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over the landmark and got a couple photo's that are ten times better than the 1976 photo's. It was confirmed that the landmark wasn't a face it was just the shadow's that made it look like a face. But of course, skeptics thought the alien markings were hidden by haze. ""It's not easy to target Cydonia"" says Garvin. ""In fact, it's hard work.""(Paragraph 9)

Then, on April 8, 2001, four years after the last photo, another couple of photo's were taken. These photo's were way clearer than the photo's from 1998. "" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" Garvin added. "" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This is proof that aliens did not make this landform.

As you can see, there is plenty of edvidence that the two mile head is a natural landform. Their is way more convicing stories about this topic. But I hope that my side of the argument conviced you that the landform wasn't built by aliens.",0
"Smoking can cause many health issues, such as; lung cancer, heart disease and respiratory disease. Evidence suggests that teen smoking may increase the use of alcohol and other drugs, illicit drugs such as marijuana, and having multiple sexual partners. Smoking not only can cause the same health hazards for teens as for adults, but also can interfere with normal lung growth. I think that anyone younger than 18 should not be legally allowed to smoke because there are so many health risks, they can cause addiction as well as cause the brain to age faster. One-third of high school smokers will eventually die of lung cancer. Teens who start smoking at a younger age are at greater risk for both lung, oral and esophageal cancer. Kids who smoke have a significantly higher risk of apendictomy surgery, often a result of appendicitis then those who don't.

Not only do the chemicals in smoke damage the natural health of a smoker teens smoking also can cause brain cells to break down at a faster rate. MRI studies have shown that teens who smoke have less efficient brain activity and smaller brain volume then teens who don't. The another study has found that the IQ of students who smoke decreased by 2.6 points, while those who refrained showed a normal increase in IQ points. These studies have been completedand reports have shown the the brain begins to age faster in teenage smokers since smoking affects mental functions. Smoking before age 17 increases the risk of cognitive impairment in middle age. Overall, there is sufficient evidence supporting the notion that teenagers should not be legally allowed to smoke. The severe health risks should deter anyone from smoking, but it seems especially important for teenagers to not get involved in the habit of smoking to live a long and healthy life.",1
"According to the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."" This planet is worthy of the risks and issues of exploration. While the author maintains to cross his point, he uses evidence and facts to change the readers' ideas of this messy planet, by comparing it to more similar terms that are more pleasent to the reader.

First the author starts by explaining and describing the unabitable conditions of the planet. The author states that ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth;"" Which are refering to the extreme temperatures of ""average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and the ""thick atmosphere of almost 97 percentage carbon dioxide blankets."" Second he follows to counterclaim his points by questioning, ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing fursther visits to its surface?"" This persuades the reader to question themselves, What is so bad about Venus? or more important What is so good about Venus? Which he replays and answers by comparing, once again, Venus with our own planet, Earth. He states that, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Changing the reader's idea or previous image, that he already provided, passing from an ""inhospitable planet"" to a planet that ""was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life.""

In conclution the author crosses his point by using evidence of a very dangerous, and unabitable planet, and what it once was and how similar it was to what is now our Earth, or also ""Venus' twin."" As a way to persuade the reader into believing that Venus is worthy of its investigations.",0
"Dating is awful and a waste of time. When you take a girl out to the time and money spent to make that girl love every minute of it is flushed down the drain when someone else asks her out on a date and the perfect day is crushed. If you ever ask someone on a date and she says yes and then you see her the next day and she is all like I can't stop thinking about jake. Would that not make you feel like a second choice? If you go on a date and the whole day until that night is amazing and then ends because you are not the first choice would you not hate dating too. So as far as I am concerned, dating is stupid and a waste of time.

Even though dating is the worst humans still will go out seeking the worst for themselves. As many people would say, dating is a learning experience. It helps teach people valuable skills that you can not always learn from others. No other person can tell you how it feels to be cheated on or to have someone fall in love with you in less than 24 hours because you are a second choice. Even though dating can end poorly i have been told that love is amazing and dating is the stepping stone to get to that. The hard lessons that one learns while dating is a key factor to successfully loving and being loved. Would you really rather not date and have to suffer through heartbreak later? I would rather prepare myself.

I am not saying that dating is the best or that there is some mythical number of perfect dates that everyone is supposed to go on. Personally. I hate the idea of wasting time, money, and energy that does not guarantee me anything. Dating is far from perfect and it will never be. But, it is a fact of life. Most people go through multiple relationships until they find the one they are supposed to be with. I am saying that I hate dating. People have been hurt for centuries in order for the human race to learn how to love and be loved. Dating is just the way we have been taught. It is not stupid it is simply a necessary part of life.",1
"Changing our ways on how we use cars for the better? Is it just so happen that people are using there car less than usual? In many places like Germany, Paris, Bogota are changing the ways to use cars. To reduce every little problem cars are causing. Traffic jams, smogs, and reducing greenhouse gas emmisions, people are getting smart about using there cars everyday. Maybe people are tired of using all cars of the time.

When people buy car, it gives them alot of freedom knowing they area able to go where ever they're heart desires. Lately people aren't feeling the whole waiting in traffic if theres an accident or just to much cars. Bus rides, trains, taxi are helping reduce this. People can go somewhere without waiting that long just for a little price. In Germany there are new laws where they put a prices to put cars and there is only certian places you can put there cars at. 70% of families in Germany have do not own cars and 57% sold there cars because of this new law? You  would think thats people would complain about having cars and having no place to put them. But many people are accuatly happy that they put this new type of law. Many people prefered to have this happen.

Smogs? what are smogs? smogs are grey clouds that hurt is in ways we dont even know. Cars emmit these deadly gases and we dont know it. Cars arent the only one who emmit they clouds of grey smoke, factories emmit this also. Which is not helping our ecosystem at all. In Paris they had an order to help redude this problem. On mondays motorists with even-numbered liscense plates were ordered to leave their cars at home which on the following day people with odd numbered liscenes plates were doing the same thing if they did not follow this ruling they were have to suffer a thirty one dollar fine. This helped alot with the smog.

Places like Germany and Paris arent the only one who are changing the ways. In Bogota they have a car free day which only allows you to take a bicycle, taxi, buses or whatever you want but do not take a car or suffer the rath of fine. Going on for three years now people are saying they enjoy these types of days because everything is more relaxing it reduces stress and air pressure which is a really good thing. Even when it rains it doesn't stop people from participating from this. There is even a 118 mile bicycle path that shows how much people want to change the way they use cars. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city: uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaces by broad, snooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""

Many sciencetists are believing that the car culture is coming to an end. Cars sales have drop alot. People are taking the bus, taxis, and even trains to avoid traffic. ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn."" Younges ages don't even drive till the age of 21 or they don't even care till then. They can usually care poll to places like partys, mall and the beach. They don't need a seperate car for each person when they are all going to the same place. Which is feel its a good and bad things. Its good because poeple are caring more that were causing harm to our own home and that they know that they can do all they want together and still have fun. It causes harm to busineses many stores could go out of business.

It does not matter if we try to stop using cars or not we are always hurting in some other way. Traffic jams, smogs and reducing greenhouse emmisions are just the begining of this all. We can do way more if we put out mind set to it.",0
"Emojis have become apart of our daily life. They are a way for us to quickly to say how we really feel. Emojis don't let for anysuspension because we can express how we feel so easily. Emojis help ous truely express our emotions.

I think emojis have helped to clear up alot of confusion. People can type the same thing but we can take it the wrong way. To keep from suspistion we put a simple smiley face to show them that we took it the right way. Having emojis is better than the ancient times when they only had words because many times words hurt. Many times were lloking like we're mad at each other but we just don't no it but with emojis everyone can tell how were feeling. I don't remember a time in my life when we didn't have emojis and don't want too because it would just be way too hard.

Emojis have taken the place of facial exspressions in standard face to face communitcation. Scholars have undermined the need of an expressive face because the emojis can just do the job. Simple picture help people exspress there emotions at it's full extent. They even have emojis that represent the incredible art of ""selfies"" there have been studies shown that the emojis that represent selfies have been used all over social media plataforms.

emjis rewords and clarifys the point we are trying to get. during meaningful discuseions and diffrences in culture. my surving topic is do you think campus alarts are troubling to your side it give many examples of diffren indexes that leads us to belive that. so technology is a prosperis thing but it's alway draw backs in this case. the main isssue with emjis is that misunderstandings can still accurres suche handwritten language perdiction pieces to us. there have being numourous raceisms to us in emojis and due to this sitting raceisim must be closely examianed. the qestion of sitting raceism and emoji morning still stands how affactove is this nonPLC actualey is. it's a clear pro does existe that does show the truce that everyone not problem findigenous and that all wants as qulatiy muslim treatment. on the other hand over anore fightenig rouud of emoji are being pertorted and by those that are puting that comuler is barracks.",1
"Cars most are used by workers, mothers, and pretty much all people in any urban area, they get us from point A to point B. But, as much as we use automobiles do we really need them? They produce smog, endanger our children and folk, and make life more stressing for us all. This can be fixed though, many places around the world have stoped using cars and even went to the length of banning them! Most importantly though they have opened our eyes to the atmospheric destruction that is caused by cars and ways we can do without them.

In Paris, a few days after nearrecord pollution, France banned driving for a couple days to clear the air or drivers will be fined up to 22 euros, or 31 dollars in America. ""Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying in smog that rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world,"" says Robert Duffer, a journalist for Paris Robert Duffer, par. 14. This amazing number just shows how even reducing the use of cars cut back the smog by over half! Imagine what our air could be like if we didn't use cars, it would help the ill and our children could breathe easily. And surprisingly enough, there are places already that do this act of banning cars and enforce it.

In Vauban, Germany there is a community of people who live in this fashion. Street parking, garages, and even driveways at homes are banned from this quaint suburban area. And, if you do own a car you have to pay almost 40,000 to park it, needless to say over 70% of families of the area don't own a car and 57% sold theirs to move to the area. A mother of two and resident of the area, Heidrun Wlater, says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" Elisabeth Rosenthal par. 3. And true to their word these kinds of urban areas have become popular in Europe and even in New York.

Car free areas have not been limited to just Europe though in America, with its large areas of urban annd suburban ideals, is now changing the way the way we think about cars. In April 2013, the miles driven per person was 9% lower than it was in January 1995 32. Although small, this cultural change in the way we are using cars is significant. Michael Sivak, a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute says, ""What most intrigues me is that the rates of car ownershipper household and pe person started to come down 2 or 3 years before the downturn, I think that means something more fundamental is going on,"" Elisabeth Rosenthal par. 33. The fact that America is changing the way we use cars is just another indicator that we should stop all together and join this carfree revolution.

To wrap it up, cars are hurting the air and they need to be cut back before we burn a hole through our atmoshpere. We're not alone in this carfree quest, many areas Europe and nothern America have started to implement this way of thinking. And lastly, this ideal is most needed in America's packed cities, the hazzard of smog and other pollution is hurt our citizens and needs to be stoped before it has longterm effect on our children. Please consider this, car in the long run are bad for the economy but, as well our health. It's snowing on Mt. Fuji.",0
"The experiences that we gain in life teach us lessons that shape the people we become later on. In ""Summer Job,"" by Steve Lampman, the author reveals that when we are put under pressure or face the ups and downs of life, we find out who we really are. Lampman also shows that sometimes we may not like what we discover about ourselves, and we can grow to become someone we did not intend to be.

In ""Summer Job,"" the author tells the story of a young boy who is going on his first job interview for a summer job. Already we learn that this boy has led a very sheltered life; his parents had always done things for him and had never allowed him to face any sort of danger. When the boy goes on the job interview and is put in a precarious situation, we see the first clue as to what he may be deep inside. In the story Lampman says, ""He stood there for a long time, unable to believe that this could be happening to him, unable to make a decision-he would have lived there all day just watching the submerged edge of the road and the little whirlpools made by the rain until the old man couldn't stand it anymore and thrust out his hand and pulled on the boys arm and said, Let's go."" In this moment we see that not only has the boy never in his whole life faced a tough decision, he simply can't make one. This tells someone that this boy has very little character. We later see that the boy's lack of character will slowly disappear and that some good will come of the situation.

When it seems that the boy will forever be a characterless young man, his true colors begin to come out. In another situation where the boy is put under great pressure, the author says, ""For the first time during the summer, the boy was furious, furious with himself, furious with everybody that was not even there."" This outburst of character after being so indecisive for his whole life shows that the boy has grown to become someone different. He has made a decision that cost him his temper, and even through his anger, he is beginning to be seen in a different light. Although the boy has grown some from living through these situations, Lampman shows us that along with the good can come the bad.",1
"Few Nasa scientists believe that the face on Mars was created by aliens. To be scientifically correct, the face is actually just a huge rock formation which are commonly found on Earth. There is no evidence supporting the clame that aliens created that landform on Mars.

Scientists have proved that the face on Mars was created by a huge rock formation. The image taken on Mars in 1998 revealed that the face is really just a natural landform. Therefore, there was no alien monument after all. Perhaps people wanted to think the face on Mars was created by aliens just so it couold be a good story for a magazine or Hollywood film, but that is not true. Scientists have revealed how the landfrom is equivalent to a butte or a mesa, which are commonly found on Earth.

With the evidence provided from scientists, the claim that aliens made the face on Mars has been proved incorrect. There is no evidence that prove that the landfrom has been created by aliens. In conclusion, aliens did not make the landform on Mars.",0

Apes also are considered very dangerous to humans because of their great strength. But for now, I’m here to tell you about apes and how they have a very close relationship to humans.

"The author say that venus is called the ""evening star"". venus is actually a planet. venus is the second sun planet from the sun. also venus is the twin of earth. venus is one of the closest planets to earth. both has the same density and size.

"The environment is becoming a very important issue all around the world. This is causing people to come up with new things that will help the earth and the people on it. The new technology is causing all of these environmental ideas to surface. Information is also becoming more available to people all around the world. Most of this new information and technology are helping the environment, but is yet still hurting it. It is helping because people are becoming more aware of the environment and how to help it. It is hurting because of all the wasted materials on all this new ""green"" technology. This is causing people to find other ways to help the environment. 

For example, some of Small Hope's solutions are to start composting again. This will not only help the environment, but also help to make money. They can do this by using only lunch scraps and buying a composter. They can then use all of that composte for their own land and to sale. This is a win- win solution. They are also trying to buy all of their food locally. This helps to support local buisnesses and not to waste energy on the road. They are also to request only one page of materials for the weeks. This will not only help to save paper, but to save ink also. It is choices like this that help to better our environment.

All around the planet people are finding ways to help the Earth. Some countries are starting to build forests on their borders to clean the air. There are other countries that are changing the material of sandwhich bags to help get rid of waste. These ideas are comming from new technology and ideas. They are helping the environment in so many ways. We are also becoming more aware of how to help the environment. This is causing more and more people to want to help better our planet. The new technology and ideas are greatly helping us to better the environment. 

http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/weekinreview/14barringer.html

The new technology is helping the environment. It is causing people to become more involved with the environment and how to better it. A great example of this is composting. Another way that the new technology is helping is by creating new land and bettering peoples lives at the same time. All of these great ideas could one day make our world a much more enjoyable place to live.",1
"Should humans be able to use cell phones while driving

Humans should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle because it can cause accidents, and even worse death. The National Safety Council today called on state and federal lawmakers to ban the use of cell phones and text-messaging devices while driving. Due to the number of accidents that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal.

A study from the Harvard Center of Risk Analysis estimates that cell phone use while driving contributes to 6 percent of crashes, which equates to 636,000 crashes, 330,000 injuries, 12,000 serious injuries and 2,600 deaths each year. Due to the number of accidents that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal. Cell phone use contributes to 6% of crashes, and drivers are at a four times greater risk of a crash.

Smartphones have made it easy for us to stay connected at all times. But that can pose serious safety risks if someone decides to check his or her text messages, emails, phone calls, or any other mobile applications while driving. Cell phone distraction rates are alarmingly high. Worst of all, the usage of cell phones before car accidents happen is known to be underreported due to potential legal issues. Using a mobile phone while driving is reckless behavior, and every single crash that happens due to it can be prevented.

The safest possible way to use a cell phone while driving would be to attach it to the radio system or another suitable hands free device via Bluetooth. The hands free device does not guarantee safety either. While the distraction from using such technology is significantly smaller, it might still cause an accident. So there is no better decision than to simply postpone calls until you have arrived at your destination.

In conclusion, humans should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle because it can cause accidents, and even worse death. Using cell phones while driving can put us at great risk, so just wait until you get to your destination",0
"James I. Padgett's ""Araby"" is the story of a young boy, living in Dublin, Ireland, industrial era. The boy is infatuated with his friend's sister and goes to extraordinary lengths to please her. Padget's theme is that one must give everything to obtain a desired object. In this case, the object is a fictional romance. The boy lives in a run-down, dilapidated part of town. The town has a sinister air to it and around it. The entire story can be summed up in the very first sentence, ""North Richmond Street being blind, was a quiet street except at the hour when the Christian Brothers' School set the boys free (Padgett 255)."" This statement is actually misleading. The school gives the boy's an artificial freedom. The boy does not take the gift and run; instead he lingers and wallows in it. James I. Padgett does a fascinating job of demonstrating this throughout the story.",1
"Cars are going to be gone in the near future. There have been talks and actions taken place to assure we limit our car usage. We as the

United States seem to have pasted our use for cars as independent owners. We have also started several different programs or actions around the world to assure we stop pollution with the use of cars. Another way we have stop the use of car is car free days in some parts of the world. Also cars are believe to be stressful to human beings.

In some parts of the world mainly Bogota, Colombia they have start to reduce the use of cars to avoid pollution and promote the use of other types of transportation. As it is stated in source 3

:

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Selsky "" The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines.""  This quote goes to show how we are starting to try to limit the usage of vehicles in this world. Also stated in source 2

:

Paris bans driving due to smog by Duffer ""Paris enforced a partial diving ban to clean the air of the global city. On Monday motorists wit even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" this shows that Paris even supports the limiting car usages by humans.

Therefore us as the United States we have shown that even we are behind in our glory days of driving cars. As stated in source 4

:

The End of Car Culture by Rosenthal "" recent studies suggest that Americans as buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" So with that have been said we need to understand we drive no matter what but slow but surely we will stop driving in general. Due to the fact of that we do need to decrease our carbon release a pond the world. As it also states from article 4

or source 4

""If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind the power plant."" This quote shows how it will affect us and also how it will benefit us as well.

Although driving feels amazing it gives you tons of stress to an individual. Not only that but it also makes you sometimes want to hurt someone. As well as feeling upset and sometimes wanting to cry due to a lack of funds to pay for gas as well as the worry of other drivers on the road. As stated in source 1

:

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Rosenthal a man states ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter. This goes to show us how we are affected by riving and even a little time away from the wheel can benefit us greatly. Another point on driving is stressful a man states in source 3

:

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota he  states It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" said Carlos Arturo Plaza. This goes and show a lot of people are in support of this act or idea.

In conclusion limiting car use will benefit us in many ways but barely affect us at all. The main idea is to limit car usage and we can do that by the law that forces us stop car use in general. Another way we can accomplish this is by being an average teen in the United States.  An added bonus is that we have loads of stress by driving. The limiting the use of driving is a way we should use to benefit us as human and to be more joyful.",0
"The Egyptian hieroglyphics were a writing system in ancient Egypt. It was a writing system that used picture symbols. The three conspirators message was really read.

"The Face is actually a natural landform. It's a huge rock formation which is also common in the American West. It's proven by Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbit Camera because it's ten time sharper than the orginal. All this mostly proves that it's not an alien monument.

When NASA reveal the image for everyone to see, the authors thought it's a good way to engage attention on Mars. According to the text, it stated, "" huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadoes giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

Most of the people thought of an alien comparacy but when Malin and his MOC team snapped a better view of it, it proves it wasn't an alien monument. According to the text, it stated, "" And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a oicture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.

If it's not an alien monument, what is it? Garvin said it was a landform which reminds him of mostly Middle Butte. According to the text it stated,"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.""

The picture is a landform after all. Most might be disappointed that it's not an alien monument. It's also been proven by the pictures over the year they had taken of which mostly is not an alien monument. Again, it's a picture of a butte or mesa, which are common around the American West.",0
"The 1960s were a turbulent decade in America, marked by the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, and the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. It was during this time that the counterculture movement emerged, a cultural revolution characterized by the rejection of traditional social norms and values. The counterculture challenged the status quo and advocated for alternative ways of thinking, living, and relating to one another. This essay will discuss the causes and consequences of the counterculture movement in America.

Firstly, it is important to understand the causes of the counterculture movement. One of the main factors that contributed to its development was the growing disillusionment with the government and the ""establishment"" during the 1960s. The Vietnam War, in particular, was a source of great dissatisfaction and opposition among young Americans. Many felt that the government was lying to them about the progress and purpose of the war, and they became increasingly frustrated with the draft process. This led to mass protests and demonstrations against the war, as well as against the government in general.

Another cause of the counterculture movement was a desire for greater personal freedom and self-expression. Young people were tired of societal expectations and constraints, and they wanted to live their lives in a way that felt authentic to them. The counterculture allowed for experimentation and exploration in all aspects of life, including political ideology, religious beliefs, and sexual orientation. The movement emphasized the importance of individualism and the rejection of conformity.

In addition to understanding the causes of the counterculture movement, it is also essential to examine its consequences. One of the most significant effects of the counterculture was its impact on social and cultural norms. The movement challenged traditional gender roles and provided a platform for the feminist movement to gain momentum. It also sparked conversations about racial equality and led to the establishment of organizations like the Black Panther Party. The counterculture also brought attention to environmental issues and played a crucial role in the development of the modern environmental movement.

Furthermore, the counterculture movement had a lasting impact on music, art, and popular culture. Genres like rock and roll and folk music became closely associated with the counterculture, and artists used their platforms to spread messages of peace, love, and social change. The counterculture also influenced fashion trends, literature, and film, and its effects can still be seen in contemporary society.

In conclusion, the counterculture movement of the 1960s was a period of significant cultural and social change in America. It was a direct response to the turbulent events of the time and a rejection of traditional social norms and values. The counterculture challenged the role of government in society, advocated for personal freedom and self-expression, and had far-reaching consequences on social, cultural, and musical norms.",1
"Facial Action Coding Systems can be a really good addition to the classroom. This technology can help teachers and staff see what a student is going through and if they need help. This could also help students show a teacher or staff memeber if they need help but don't know how to ask.

Facial Action Coding Systems is a program that lets a computer read human emotion and can show statistics of how you are feeling this is support by the quote, ""She's eighty-three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and two percent angry. No, that's not your science teacher,grading your latest lab assignment. Its the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa at least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotion."" The software can help teachers actually help students with mental health instead of writing them a slip and just saying you are fine. Also teachers can tell you how to coop with certain stresses bust by scaning you with a computer program. This can also help teachers find the student that caused trouble if they are not cooperating, because the program can tell if the subject is lying or not. This claim is supported by the following quote. "" To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clies are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" polictician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" The program can also help schools by seeing if a student is under a lot of pressure and needs help right away.

The overall claim is that I believe that Facial Action Coding System program can really improve mental stability with students and solve disputes between them. The system can really help teachers find out what students need help if they are afraid to reach out. The Facial Action Coding System program could be a really good addition to classrooms.",0
