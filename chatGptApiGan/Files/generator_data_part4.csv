"The story ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" Main purpuse was to in form us of the stugles of trying to find a whay to get humons on Venus, Then giving us informashon of why its so hard to find a whay to live on Venus, for example Its eghat hunders degrees Farenheit, and that the presher is ninedy times more preshere than are planet. Then give us some examples of how there testing on how to live on Venus by tresing things at the bottom of the ocecn.

The main reason why they are doing this is, because Venus is the most like planet to earth in are soilersiston, so if we need to we can go thare to live if the earth is going to be distored.

So with this informashon I can conculed that this arical is to infrom us of what is going on with space trave in the fucher.",0
"Should Drivers Be Able to Use Cell Phones While Driving?

""The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving."" Drivers shouldn't be able to use their phones while driving because it creates a distraction that could not only lead to injury to the person on their phone but also other innocent drivers on the road. Even the most experienced drivers can find themselves losing control of the wheel while concentrating on their phones. Also driving is a task that requires constant awareness, any type of diversion can lead to accidents no matter how quick it is. In a lot of cases death and serious injury is the result of ""glancing"" at your phone even for two seconds. In reality no text, call, video, etc is worth losing a life over.

Additionally the mortality rate behind using cellphones while driving has caused some states to take legal action. 19 states have banned hand-held cell phone usage while diving, 39 states bans any cell phone usage for novice drivers, 20 states bans any cell phone usage for school buses and 48 states have banned texting while driving. So not only is cell phone usage while driving dangerous but also illegal. So if you are using a cellphone you risk getting into an accident and getting into trouble with the law, which could possibly require jail time or a fine. Also this can affect your insurance, constant tickets and fines from texting while driving can make your insurance go up almost two times its original cost.

According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause car accidents. Studies show that using a cell phone can make you 4x more likely to crash. Despite the dangers, people still use their cell phones while driving to communicate or occupy themselves. Some may argue that using hands-free features is safe, but research shows it can be just as dangerous as holding the phone because the conversation can distract drivers from the road. Distracted drivers have a slower reaction time meaning in case of an emergency where they need to make a quick move they won't be able to. Having that quick extinct when you're not distracted could make the difference between life and death.

Although people may say ""It was just a one time thing, I barely text while driving."" Science begs a differ, during recent years it has been studied that texting while driving has become a huge epidemic. Scientist have even compared it to craving junk food, stating that like junk food we crave being on our phones. Study shows that the average person check their phone once every 12 minutes and 80 times a day. So using your phone while driving can definitely become a habit even if you just do it a ""couple times"".

In conclusion, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people's responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives. Putting up your cell phone and waiting until you're at a stable place can save your life. No one should put themselves or others at risk to reply to a text message. Even if you're hands-free it can still distract you on the road and make you unable to make detrimental last minute decisions.

Everyone should be mindful of everyone and themselves and focus only on driving when their on the road.",0
"Chaos on Venus? Venus is one the hottest planets in our solar system and the most dangerous planet to explore. The author beleives that trying to explore Venus isn't worth it despite all the dangers in presents. Venus isn't safe for humans to explore. Our mechines wouldn't be much help to explore Venus. Even if we get humans close to Venus, they would still to get close enough to take simples.

Venus isn't safe for humans. Venus is to hot for humans to vist and is constantly expericencing natural dangers. In paragraph 3 it states that,"" Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like eruping volcanoes, powerful earth quakes, and frequent lightning strkes to probes seeking on its surface."" This shows that Venus is safe for humans.

Our mechines wouldn't be much help againist the dangers of Venus. Because of the atmosphere pressure, most thing would just get destroyed or crushed. In the paragraph 3 it states that,""the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet .These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" The proves that our mechines wouldn't be much help.

Even if we can get humans to Venus safey, they would still have to get close to surface to takes samples and there are risk to getting closer to surface. In paragraph 6 it states that,"" However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most form of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard froms of photography and videography ineffective. more importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a through miss to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk."" These are all good example as to why visting Venus would be worthless and how humans would have to get close enough to Venus to take some type of sample.

In conclusion, visting isn't safe for humans. Mechines would be much help exploring Venus. Even if humans got to Venus it wouldn't make a difference to the risk and dangers of being on Venus. There for studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.",0
"What would it be like without cars? Well acording to the passages there are a lot of cities that are trying this car free world. The one city that are free of cars is Vauban,Germany. So lets see how they like the car free communtiy.

The frist place were looking at is Vauban,Gremany. they have a total car free rule. they cant have car in the town . but if they have to park them they have to buy a space for $40,000 along with a house. As a result 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars.57 percent sold a car to move here. Vauban completed inn 2006 , Is a example of a growing trend in Europe, The united states and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use. As a componet of a movement called ""smart planning"".

The end of car culture. President Obama's ambitious goals are to curb the United states' greenhouse gas emissions. Unvail last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in America behavior,recent studies suggest that America are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year gose by. Americas love affair with its vehicals seems to be cooling down. when adjusted for population growth ,the number of miles driven in the united states peaked in 2005 and stedily dropped thereafter. Therefor if the pattern is perists and many sociologist belive it will ,It will have benefical impacts on the world's carbon emissions. so let all try to be car free and hgelp the enviroment!",0
"On May 21, 2016, Christina Mays had been told by her doctor, that she would be expecting her first child. Excited and anxious she decided to text her husband the good news. David Mays was delighted about the news and responded with a sweet message. It is not clear whether Christina saw that sweet message before her car slammed into the back of a truck while merging onto the highway. From the lack of response, David became worried. He attempted to call Christina and left several messages requesting to hear her beautiful voice. But to no avail he could not reach her. David knew something horrible had happened. Christina, a beautiful twenty-year-old was dead. Police ultimately deemed texting the cause of her fatal car crash.

Although the police found evidence that texting and driving caused her untimely death; the likelihood of a car crash increases drastically with the occurrence of distracted driving.

Distracted driving occurs anytime a driver takes their eyes off the road, hands off the wheel or sometimes just simply being a teen carrying too many passengers.

Distracted driving is a huge problem, although it is not due to cell phones alone, they are a huge contributor. Taking your eyes off the road, even for a second, can be risky. Because operating a cellphone takes the drivers attention off the road, long enough for them to veer into other lanes of on-coming traffic. Because of this, it only takes a split second for this type of distracted driving to become a fatality. For this reason, it is necessary for drivers to focus on driving only and leave their cellphones in their pockets.

Secondly, text messaging requires you to visually and manually use sometimes both of your hands; it is by far the most frightening distraction used by not just teens, but adults as well. Most vehicles are considered a weapon. Consequently, they can cause extreme damages during a crash. This is why it is never safe to take your hands off the wheel, even to answer a call. As a result of this, some states have chosen to pass laws prohibiting motorist form using their cellular devices while operating a motor vehicle.

Lastly, most of us realize that social media rules the land. In this day in age, if it's not recorded it didn't happen. Seeing that teen drivers lack experience while driving. Consequently, means that they require more focus than experienced drivers. Therefore, carrying too many passengers while trying to operate a cellphone is hazardous to all parties involved, including innocent bystanders. Studies have shown that too many passengers can be a huge distraction, especially while using a cell phone.

In conclusion, texting and any type of distracted driving seems to be a social issue and will possibly take individuals awhile to change or completely stop. Hopefully people will understand sooner than later, that multitasking while driving is dangerous for all.",0
"Everyone nowadays is so used to driving a car here and there even if it would just be five minutes on foot, but what if you started limiting your car usuage? Making your feet be your gas instead of a pump when the distance is close enough, and even biking occasionally. Limiting car usuage may sound like a bad thing, but it has many advangtages such as reducing pollutin, increasing saftety for human beings, and even opeing options for alternative transportion.

Cars release a great amount of polluants into the air increasing smog in some areas worse than others, like in Paris, China, and other places. Providing or opening your mind to other ways to get from one destination to the next, would reduce the smog thats in the air. This simple action as close to 70% of the population pitching in can result in a healthier environment, and some people may agree with Heidurn Walter. She says ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way."" Not only that, people who do not agree or get rid of their transportion vechicles will be fined. For example, in Germany you have to pay $40,000 if you want to get a car owner space and this does not include the money you have to spend on your house. Than, in Paris 4,000 drivers were fined $31 dollars after not leaving their cars home after a public annocement was made to do so. This shows that opening this can increase health, or make an environment cleanier. Plus, you actually inforcing something that is good for the environment will get people to participate, such as a fine.

Hearing engines roar and cars zoom pace is a sound all too familar with citizens who walk or ride constantly. It can be quite on the thrilling side crossing the streets or even walking down a busy rode when you know being hit is a possibly. Limiting car usage can decrease the risks or heavy weighted vechicles hitting biking, or walking citizens that dont have a chance against the weight. This increases saftety, bumping into another human or being nugded by a bike wont affect your body as much as a 500 pound or even heavier car crashing into a 100 pound person. Like, Carlos Arturo said ""It's a good opportuinity to take away stress..."" meaning the stess that comes with a car. The money for gas and the risk or hitting someone or being hit is taken away when on foot or on bike. This shows limting car usage isnt only increasing the safety or people walking or biking, it also takes away stess factors like money, fixing a car if it needs repair, and other factors.

Finally, having alternate forms of transportion can open your eyes to a whole need world. Instead of constanly beiong locked in your 4 door honda prison or your house you're outside seeing new people and increasing social interaction. Not only this, but you're getting excerise and maintaining your health or builing it. Which is another reason to limit the amount we use our cars. This shows that doing so can not only increase saftery, and money, but health and social oppurtunitys.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has many advangtages even if you dont realize it and our soiciety could benefit a lot from it. Like, when it comes to the safety of the next generation, the present, or the previous. Than, it can even take away stress that come with a vechicle and even increase health and social gathering.",0
"Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions (Rosenthal 34). Global warming is becoming more of an issue as time goes on,  part of this problem is vehicles and their pollution they let off. People are getting more and more worried about this as temperatures continue to rise on Earth. They are trying to do something about it. One of the more popular suggestions to help solve the issue is to limit car usage. I know, it seems pretty bizare due to the fact that some towns, such as my own, do not have everything citizens need within a walking distance. Benefically, ""stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.(Rosenthal 6)"". It is thought that it will ""drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States (Rosenthal 5)"". People also are not putting forth an effort to help decrease the pollution by buying hybrids, instead they buy Diesels. Diesel gas has more pollutants then regular gasoline.

Safety is another reason to reduce car usage. Think about it, if pedestrians reduced their car usage by 50 percent the percentage of car accidents would also decrease. This could save many people's lives; animals as well. Rosenthal said, ""Cities could become denser, and better for walking"", which also makes it safer. To go along with saving lives lets mention health. Americans are getting more and more unhealthy and overweight. It is a rising problem in our country. Many people die from it everyday; obesity can be stopped. One way to lose weight and get in shape is exercise. Imagine how much better shape Americans would be in if we actually had to walk to the grocery store or McDonald's. It would make us think ""do we really need that?"". Those extra burned calories count, sitting in a car does not burn many calories.

Traffic jams are aggravating to most people, with the decreasing number of car owners time is being saved. There is less traffic. Andrew Selsky studied car-free day in Bogota, and he stated ""rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic(28)"", this means time is being saved and people are getting to their destinations faster. Another idea was said by Carlos Arturo Plaza ""it's a good opprotunity to take away stress...(Selsky 24)"". Congestion stresses everyone out, whether running on time, running late or just taking a leisurely drive. It makes everyone stress. Congestion actually decreased 60 percent in Paris (Duffer 14). Heidrun Walter also said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.""

Limiting car usage helps a number of problems throughout the globe, such as to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, improve safety, and even improve your health (Rosenthal 43). You may wonder what other ways are there for you transport to the places you need to go. You could walk, jog, hike, bike, skate, or take public transportation. There are so many options and you have the opprotunity to meet new people and exercise if you're having a busy day. America should try it out just for a day and see what it leads to.",0
"Phones and Driving

In these times, phones are a huge distraction while on the road of driving. A Georgia law was made that drivers are to have a phone holder while driving in the vehicle, but there is still a large abundance of deaths in due to car accidents. According to research conducted at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away their phone while driving outweigh any drawbacks. In my opinion, I believe that phones should not be allowed of use during driving because it is inconsiderate of other drivers, it is illegal, it increases the number of deaths per year, and because it's a myth of multitasking while driving.

One reason I believe that phones should not be allowed of use during driving because it increases the number of deaths per year. For example, cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. Distracted driving is dangerous, and cell phone use while driving is a major factor. In 2018 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving was involved in 2,841 motor vehicle crash fatalities. Among those killed: 1,730 drivers, 605 passengers, 400 pedestrians and 77 bicyclists. Knowing cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help people manage a dangerous crash risk. Though texting and driving caused many injuries and deaths, there are still people who don't think it's a problem and are confident that they can use their phone and drive simultaneously. However, 34% of teens aged sixteen to seventeen spend about 10% of their driving time outside of their lane. This affects other people who are driving and can cause the deaths of innocent lives.

Another reason I believe that phones should not be allowed of use during driving because it is inconsiderate of other drivers. The consciousness of events happening around vehicle has a huge impact on driving. It is necessary for the drivers to monitor outside events and their possible impacts on driving. Using cell phones make it difficult to keep an eye on the outside events. Negligent behavior is highly immoral and unethical as it exposes human lives to a huge threat of accidents that could ultimately lead even to death. Now, a new study indicates that damn near everybody uses their phone while behind the wheel, damn near all the time. Using sensor data from more than 3 million drivers and 5.6 billion miles of trips, driving analytics company Zendrive found drivers are using their phones on 88 percent of their journeys. The average driver spends 3.5 minutes on the phone per hour trip, a stat that sounds worse when you realize just a two-second distraction increases your risk of crashing by 20 percent.

The last reason I believe that phones should not be allowed of use during driving because it's a myth of multitasking while driving. Multitasking is valued in today's culture, and our drive for increased productivity makes it tempting to use cell phones while behind the wheel. People often think they are effectively accomplishing two tasks at the same time. And yes, they may complete a phone conversation while they drive and arrive at their destination without incident, thus accomplishing two tasks during the same time frame.",0
"The advantages of limiting car usage is that many people needs a car for certain reasons and some may not because they would rather walk, take the bus, or may ride their bikes. Having a car may come in handy to some people because they are organize to have summer jobs and have social life around where they can walk and take public transportation or may even car pool with friends. People who do live in cities often take the bus, walk, and cabs if needed to.

Not all have cars in big cities because it cost more for gas and some probably can't drive. Since driving is becoming more big in life more teenagers and young adults are driving more often. Living in the suburbs you'll will need to drive because everything isn't close by each other it's more distance so maybe you'll probably have to walk or may ride a bike to get where your trying to go.

""With all these changes people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habbit.""  Well because they may feel that having something to do with a car may cost them alot. Not alot of people can afford cars and what the car needs for it to work properly instuff. People who did have a car were always intense because they never knew what can happen with the car.

Transportantion for America is a fast growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States. They want people in the community that live in the suburbs to pay more because using a car cost more than living in cities in that when your living in the cities you really wouldn't have that much to do because it's walking distance.

If your living on an island you probably wouldn't need a car that much because everything is like near or to close. Having a car on a island isn't really much needed to be honest you would barely use it which would be a waste of money for half of the stuff you may use to get on the car.",0
"In my personal opinion, I believe a computer that can read a humans's emotions by just the picture on their face, would be a great idea for children. "" A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" that detail would be exstreamly valuble, if it became real in the future. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor"". Can you imagine of how student problems can solved, now with this new piece of technology?

However, a good side may also have bad side. Technology is still growing and becoming more useful then ever, we use techology everywhere, for daily life plans,communicating,playing games even shopping. With those pros, come with cons, technology also has become a tool for unkindness like cyber bullying, not only that. But sick minded people, who find ways to spy on others inside their private homes through their computer cameras. Yes, their are simple remedies, like put your computer away with the top down, or when your on soical media. Don't give friends your password or post anything you know would be harmful, so a perosn can hack into it, connect to wifi's that don't allow EVERYONE to connect to them, because (it does'nt happen all the time) a person with the right system can see what your doing on your phone.

In a conclusion, my point is now, that scientists want computers to

""'calculate' emotions"" . Hackers COULD find a stronger way, to make things dangerouse for people by reading their emotions through the person's private computer (unless this idea only stay in school sytems). Now, I know I may sound paraniod or even carzy, but if we're honest technology is scary. Not saying we should never use it or through it away, of course not ,it's become people's life blood now, we it for everything. More over, it's the people behind the techonogy that do the harm. Not the technology itself. I just really don't want to give more unkind people a better chance of physicaly or emtionaly hurting someone.

At the end of the day, I just don't want to give more unkind people like bullies,hackers and others be given a better chance of physiaclly or emitonaly hurting someone. It's great if scientists to come up with new ways to save people through techonogy, reading a perosn's emotions can fix things and not just for children but young adults, adults the elderly .Even people with specal dissablities, if their being tested, a computer can tell if they understand through the emitionals they give infront of the computer. I just want it to have a postive effact rather then a negitve one.",0
