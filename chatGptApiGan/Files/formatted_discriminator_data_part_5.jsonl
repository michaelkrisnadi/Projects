Although hurricanes devastate residents each year, there are advantages to living in the Bahamas, such as the breathtaking scenery, the friendly locals, the beautiful water, the government's response time to natural disasters, and how the government helps the residents after a natural disaster.\n\nThe Bahamas is known for being the most beautiful place on the earth, with beaches and breathtaking scenery. A day on the beach in the Bahamas is not like a day on the beach in America; it is more private and peaceful. Also, the color of the Bahamian water is the first feature that catches an American's attention because it is more blue. There is also a taste to the water, but it is not salty, it has more of a flavor.\n\nAnother advantage of living in the Bahamas is that the Bahamian citizens are very welcoming and friendly to the American residents. There is a number of people who moved to the Bahamas after receiving a warm welcome. Also, there is a type of ethnic mixture of people that adds a different flavor to the Bahamas. This ethnic mingling is very intriguing because there is always something to talk about and something to focus on.\n\nThe 1st type of treasure in the Bahamas is in the beautiful scenery. The second is in Bahamian residents themselves. The 3rd and final thing that the Bahamian citizens use to their advantage is the Bahamian government. One American witness said that \"the difference between the U.S. and the Bahamas, though, is the people and the government. In the U.S., politicians always promise they will help, but they rarely act.\". People can learn from this statement because in the Bahamas a politician's word means everything, which means that a fake promise is equivalent to false hope. This also means that if the person cannot come through on a promise, then they should have never promised the thing in the first place; Bahamian politicians operate following this creed.\n\nThough the Bahamian government acts on promises, the rule is that no politician or person is ever perfect. These people do make mistakes, although that does not stop them. The Bahamian people brush off and keep going after a mistake has been made, that is just how they operate. They lose sight of the material things and the things that do not truly matter, and they focus on what is truly clear.\n\nThese are advantages of living in The Bahamas. Though there are risks in living in there, the people of the Bahamas band together to overcome the obstacles that lie in their paths.\n\nSophomore Sparknotes, Inc., SPARKNEWS expeditions and SPARKSCHOOL exist as expenses unlike any other. They are unique in the fact that the are full of experiences and of sometime dreadful life-threating actions, as they are full of beauty, the absolitius beauty in the lesson or lesosn that will be discovered. Ond of the great lessons learned through Sparkhope, in particular, is not to survive through ones struggles but to g upgrade anyone who can makes perseveres and presses on, and while there are lig lesson along the way, they each tie back to th overall significance of understanding the worth and importance of Sparkhope."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This text is AI-generated."}]}

It just so happens that the natural landform look's like a face.\n\nWhy would the aliens spend their time making a two mile long face anyways? These natural landform's are common in Cydonia, only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoh. It is indeed interesting and cool to think that it was built by aliens, but it wasn't built by aliens. Don't get me wrong, everyone wishes it was made by aliens, but facts are facts.\n\nIn 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over the landmark and got a couple photo's that are ten times better than the 1976 photo's. It was confirmed that the landmark wasn't a face it was just the shadow's that made it look like a face. But of course, skeptics thought the alien markings were hidden by haze. \"It's not easy to target Cydonia\" says Garvin. \"In fact, it's hard work.\"(Paragraph 9)\n\nThen, on April 8, 2001, four years after the last photo, another couple of photo's were taken. These photo's were way clearer than the photo's from 1998. \" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,\" Garvin added. \" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" This is proof that aliens did not make this landform.\n\nAs you can see, there is plenty of edvidence that the two mile head is a natural landform.

Evidence suggests that teen smoking may increase the use of alcohol and other drugs, illicit drugs such as marijuana, and having multiple sexual partners. Smoking not only can cause the same health hazards for teens as for adults, but also can interfere with normal lung growth. I think that anyone younger than 18 should not be legally allowed to smoke because there are so many health risks, they can cause addiction as well as cause the brain to age faster. One-third of high school smokers will eventually die of lung cancer. Teens who start smoking at a younger age are at greater risk for both lung, oral and esophageal cancer. Kids who smoke have a significantly higher risk of apendictomy surgery, often a result of appendicitis then those who don't.\n\nNot only do the chemicals in smoke damage the natural health of a smoker teens smoking also can cause brain cells to break down at a faster rate. MRI studies have shown that teens who smoke have less efficient brain activity and smaller brain volume then teens who don't. The another study has found that the IQ of students who smoke decreased by 2.6 points, while those who refrained showed a normal increase in IQ points. These studies have been completedand reports have shown the the brain begins to age faster in teenage smokers since smoking affects mental functions. Smoking before age 17 increases the risk of cognitive impairment in middle age. Overall, there is sufficient evidence supporting the notion that teenagers should not be legally allowed to smoke. The severe health risks should deter anyone from smoking, but it seems especially important for teenagers to not get involved in the habit of smoking to live a long and healthy life."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This text is AI-generated."}]}

If you go on a date and the whole day until that night is amazing and then ends because you are not the first choice would you not hate dating too. So as far as I am concerned, dating is stupid and a waste of time.\n\nEven though dating is the worst humans still will go out seeking the worst for themselves. As many people would say, dating is a learning experience. It helps teach people valuable skills that you can not always learn from others. No other person can tell you how it feels to be cheated on or to have someone fall in love with you in less than 24 hours because you are a second choice. Even though dating can end poorly i have been told that love is amazing and dating is the stepping stone to get to that. The hard lessons that one learns while dating is a key factor to successfully loving and being loved. Would you really rather not date and have to suffer through heartbreak later? I would rather prepare myself.\n\nI am not saying that dating is the best or that there is some mythical number of perfect dates that everyone is supposed to go on. Personally. I hate the idea of wasting time, money, and energy that does not guarantee me anything. Dating is far from perfect and it will never be. But, it is a fact of life. Most people go through multiple relationships until they find the one they are supposed to be with. I am saying that I hate dating.

Maybe people are tired of using all cars of the time.\n\nWhen people buy car, it gives them alot of freedom knowing they area able to go where ever they're heart desires. Lately people aren't feeling the whole waiting in traffic if theres an accident or just to much cars. Bus rides, trains, taxi are helping reduce this. People can go somewhere without waiting that long just for a little price. In Germany there are new laws where they put a prices to put cars and there is only certian places you can put there cars at. 70% of families in Germany have do not own cars and 57% sold there cars because of this new law? You\u00a0 would think thats people would complain about having cars and having no place to put them. But many people are accuatly happy that they put this new type of law.

Cars arent the only one who emmit they clouds of grey smoke, factories emmit this also. Which is not helping our ecosystem at all. In Paris they had an order to help redude this problem. On mondays motorists with even-numbered liscense plates were ordered to leave their cars at home which on the following day people with odd numbered liscenes plates were doing the same thing if they did not follow this ruling they were have to suffer a thirty one dollar fine. This helped alot with the smog.\n\nPlaces like Germany and Paris arent the only one who are changing the ways. In Bogota they have a car free day which only allows you to take a bicycle, taxi, buses or whatever you want but do not take a car or suffer the rath of fine. Going on for three years now people are saying they enjoy these types of days because everything is more relaxing it reduces stress and air pressure which is a really good thing. Even when it rains it doesn't stop people from participating from this. There is even a 118 mile bicycle path that shows how much people want to change the way they use cars. \"Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city: uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaces by broad, snooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\"\n\nMany sciencetists are believing that the car culture is coming to an end.

But, as much as we use automobiles do we really need them? They produce smog, endanger our children and folk, and make life more stressing for us all. This can be fixed though, many places around the world have stoped using cars and even went to the length of banning them! Most importantly though they have opened our eyes to the atmospheric destruction that is caused by cars and ways we can do without them.\n\nIn Paris, a few days after nearrecord pollution, France banned driving for a couple days to clear the air or drivers will be fined up to 22 euros, or 31 dollars in America. \"Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying in smog that rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world,\" says Robert Duffer, a journalist for Paris Robert Duffer, par. 14. This amazing number just shows how even reducing the use of cars cut back the smog by over half! Imagine what our air could be like if we didn't use cars, it would help the ill and our children could breathe easily. And surprisingly enough, there are places already that do this act of banning cars and enforce it.\n\nIn Vauban, Germany there is a community of people who live in this fashion. Street parking, garages, and even driveways at homes are banned from this quaint suburban area. And, if you do own a car you have to pay almost 40,000 to park it, needless to say over 70% of families of the area don't own a car and 57% sold theirs to move to the area. A mother of two and resident of the area, Heidrun Wlater, says, \"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,\" Elisabeth Rosenthal par. 3. And true to their word these kinds of urban areas have become popular in Europe and even in New York.\n\nCar free areas have not been limited to just Europe though in America, with its large areas of urban annd suburban ideals, is now changing the way the way we think about cars. In April 2013, the miles driven per person was 9% lower than it was in January 1995 32. Although small, this cultural change in the way we are using cars is significant. Michael Sivak, a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute says, \"What most intrigues me is that the rates of car ownershipper household and pe person started to come down 2 or 3 years before the downturn, I think that means something more fundamental is going on,\" Elisabeth Rosenthal par. 33. The fact that America is changing the way we use cars is just another indicator that we should stop all together and join this carfree revolution.\n\nTo wrap it up, cars are hurting the air and they need to be cut back before we burn a hole through our atmoshpere. We're not alone in this carfree quest, many areas Europe and nothern America have started to implement this way of thinking. And lastly, this ideal is most needed in America's packed cities, the hazzard of smog and other pollution is hurt our citizens and needs to be stoped before it has longterm effect on our children.

Lampman also shows that sometimes we may not like what we discover about ourselves, and we can grow to become someone we did not intend to be.\n\nIn \"Summer Job,\" the author tells the story of a young boy who is going on his first job interview for a summer job. Already we learn that this boy has led a very sheltered life; his parents had always done things for him and had never allowed him to face any sort of danger. When the boy goes on the job interview and is put in a precarious situation, we see the first clue as to what he may be deep inside. In the story Lampman says, \"He stood there for a long time, unable to believe that this could be happening to him, unable to make a decision-he would have lived there all day just watching the submerged edge of the road and the little whirlpools made by the rain until the old man couldn't stand it anymore and thrust out his hand and pulled on the boys arm and said, Let's go.\" In this moment we see that not only has the boy never in his whole life faced a tough decision, he simply can't make one. This tells someone that this boy has very little character. We later see that the boy's lack of character will slowly disappear and that some good will come of the situation.\n\nWhen it seems that the boy will forever be a characterless young man, his true colors begin to come out. In another situation where the boy is put under great pressure, the author says, \"For the first time during the summer, the boy was furious, furious with himself, furious with everybody that was not even there.\" This outburst of character after being so indecisive for his whole life shows that the boy has grown to become someone different. He has made a decision that cost him his temper, and even through his anger, he is beginning to be seen in a different light. Although the boy has grown some from living through these situations, Lampman shows us that along with the good can come the bad."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This text is AI-generated."}]}
