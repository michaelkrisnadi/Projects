Lack of self-confidence in students is a widespread issue that can be attributed to several different factors. Factors that contribute to a lack of confidence can include social pressures, academic struggles, and a lack of recognition for success. Fortunately, there are strategies that students can use to build their self-confidence and overcome these issues. Praise and accomplishment are two key elements in building self-confidence; praise can help boost one’s morale and give them the motivation to keep going, while accomplishment can show one’s success and help build a sense of pride. However, there are also numerous challenges that students face when trying to build their self-confidence. For some, risk-taking may be a difficult prospect, while others may find it hard to shake off the effects of personal problems. Understanding and addressing these issues, students can make strides when it comes to boosting their self-confidence.",1
"Specialization has been the norm for many years, with individuals focusing on specific fields to become experts in their respective areas. However, the focus on specialization has led to the degradation of general knowledge and the inability to see the broader picture. Consequently, there is a growing need for generalists who can provide a broad perspective. In my opinion, I agree with the assertion that we need more generalists than specialists. This essay will provide specific reasons and examples to support this view.

First, generalists can quickly adapt to different environments and situations. In today's fast-paced world, adaptability is an essential skill that individuals must possess to succeed. Specialization often results in a narrow focus, leading to difficulty adapting to new situations. Generalists, on the other hand, have a broad understanding of various situations and can quickly adapt to changes. For instance, a generalist who has a broad understanding of finance, marketing, and management can easily switch between these fields, depending on the situation. This adaptability is essential when working in a dynamic environment such as a start-up company.

Second, generalists are better problem solvers. They can view situations from different perspectives and come up with innovative solutions. Specialists, on the other hand, are often too focused on their area of expertise, making it difficult for them to see the bigger picture. Generalists have a broader understanding of various fields and can use this knowledge to identify the root cause of a problem and come up with a solution that considers all factors. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, generalists who had a broad understanding of healthcare, economics, and politics were better equipped to provide solutions that considered all these factors.

Third, generalists are better communicators. They can translate complex ideas into simple language that can be easily understood by people from different fields. Specialists, on the other hand, often use jargon that is difficult for non-experts to understand. Generalists can bridge the communication gap between different fields, leading to better collaboration and problem-solving. For instance, a generalist who has a broad understanding of technology, finance, and law can easily communicate with professionals from these fields and provide insights that are easily understood.

Finally, generalists are better leaders. They have a broad understanding of different fields, enabling them to make informed decisions that consider different perspectives. Leaders who are generalists are better equipped to guide their teams towards a common goal, leading to better outcomes. For example, Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, was a generalist who had a broad understanding of technology, design, and business. His leadership style was informed by his broad understanding of these fields, leading to the creation of innovative products that revolutionized the tech industry.

In conclusion, the focus on specialization has resulted in the degradation of general knowledge and the inability to see the bigger picture. Consequently, there is a growing need for generalists who can provide a broad perspective. Generalists have a range of skills that make them better problem-solvers, communicators, leaders, and adaptable to different situations. Therefore, I agree that we need more generalists than specialists.

Working in a group versus working alone has many advantages and disadvantages, and in many cases it can depend on personal preference. Working in a group can be advantageous in that it allows for more ideas to come together, leading to positive outcomes. In addition, more tasks can get completed in a shorter amount of time when two or more people work together. However, there are also some potential disadvantages to working in a group, such as personality clashes and arguments. These issues can lead to tensions among the group members and potentially impede progress. It is important to consider that working in a group or working alone both have benefits and drawbacks and that it may depend on personal preferences when it comes to deciding which option is best.",1
"In today's society, it is often argued that men are becoming more greedy and selfish. Some people believe that we should return to older, traditional values and show respect for family and local community. While I agree that traditional values are important, I do not believe that men are becoming more selfish and greedy. In this essay, I will explain my reasons for this opinion.

Firstly, it is important to recognize that traditional values are not always applicable to modern society. For example, in the past, women were expected to stay at home and take care of the children while men went out to work. However, in today's society, women have the same opportunities as men and can pursue careers if they choose to do so. Therefore, it is not always possible or desirable to return to traditional values.

Secondly, I do not believe that men are becoming more selfish and greedy. While there are certainly some men who exhibit these traits, there are also many men who are kind, generous, and compassionate. It is unfair to generalize all men as being selfish and greedy based on the actions of a few individuals.

Furthermore, I believe that it is important to recognize that society as a whole has become more individualistic. This is not just a problem among men, but among all people. In today's society, people are encouraged to pursue their own interests and goals, often at the expense of others. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, it can lead to a lack of community spirit and a breakdown of traditional values.

In conclusion, while I agree that traditional values are important, I do not believe that men are becoming more selfish and greedy. It is important to recognize that traditional values are not always applicable to modern society and that society as a whole has become more individualistic. Instead of blaming men for this trend, we should work together to promote a sense of community and respect for others.

"There are many skills of English, but which one is more important for Chinese learners? Some people think that we should give priority to reading in English, while others think speaking is more important. I agree that speaking is more important.

The reason why I think speaking is more important is that speaking is the basis of communication. If we can't speak, we can't communicate with others. We can't make friends with foreigners, we can't learn from them and we can't understand their culture. Speaking is the key to communication.

Another reason is that speaking can help us to improve our other skills. For example, if we want to improve our listening, we can listen to English radio or TV. But if we don't understand what they are saying, we can't improve our listening. Speaking can help us to understand what they are saying and then we can improve our listening.

In addition, speaking can help us to remember words and grammar. When we speak, we have to use grammar and vocabulary. If we don't use them, we will forget them. So speaking is a good way to remember them.

Of course, reading is also important. Reading can help us to learn grammar and vocabulary. But we can learn grammar and vocabulary from speaking, too. So I think speaking is more important than reading.

"There are a few key things to remember when considering this question. First, children are not born knowing how to cooperate or compete; these are skills that must be learned. Second, both cooperation and competition can be beneficial to children; it depends on the context in which they are used. Finally, it is possible for children to learn both cooperation and competition; they are not mutually exclusive.

With that said, I believe that children should be taught to cooperate. Cooperation is essential for many aspects of life, from working on a team to simply getting along with others. It is a skill that can be used in any situation, and it is one that will serve children well as they grow up.

There are a few reasons why I believe cooperation is so important for children. First, it teaches them to be considerate of others. When children cooperate, they have to think about the needs of others and how their actions will affect them. This is an important lesson to learn, as it will help them to be more thoughtful and considerate people as they grow up.

Second, cooperation teaches children to compromise. This is another essential life skill, as it is often necessary to compromise in order to get along with others. When children learn to compromise, they learn to see things from another person’s perspective and to find common ground. This is a skill that will be useful in all kinds of relationships, both personal and professional.

Finally, cooperation helps children to build relationships. When children cooperate, they have to communicate and work together. This can help them to build strong relationships with others, as they learn to trust and rely on each other. These are important skills to have, both in childhood and adulthood.

Of course, competition can also be beneficial to children. It can teach them to set goals and to work hard to achieve them. It can also teach them to be resilient in the face of failure. However, I believe that cooperation is more important, as it is a skill that can be used in any situation and that will help children throughout their lives.

"For many people, the idea of early retirement can be very appealing. They envision a life free from work and financial worries as they enter into their golden years while still being able to enjoy all the things they love doing. Although it is possible to make this dream a reality, there are several considerations that should be taken into account when planning for an early retirement. The first step in preparing for early retirement is ensuring you have enough money saved up before you stop working completely. It's important to look at your current expenses and determine how much money will be needed each month after retiring. This includes not only living expenses such as rent or mortgage payments but also any potential medical costs or travel expenses you may incur in the future. Once you know what funds will be necessary for your lifestyle, start building up your savings so that when it comes time to retire you won't need to worry about running out of money too soon or having insufficient funds when unexpected costs arise. Another factor involved with early retirement planning is taking advantage of tax breaks and other government programs designed specifically for those who have retired earlier than expected or who are on fixed incomes due to disability or age-related health issues. There are often credits available for those who meet certain criteria such as income level and number of years worked prior to retiring which can go a long way towards decreasing annual taxes owed on income earned during these years off from work activities. Additionally, if one spouse has already begun collecting Social Security benefits then it might also be beneficial if the other begins receiving theirs earlier as well since both parties could potentially benefit by combining their payments together instead of waiting until full eligibility age arrives before collecting anything at all from that source either separately or together depending upon individual circumstances surrounding each situation . Finally, it's essential that anyone considering an early retirement think about ways in which they plan on filling their days once freedom from employment comes around - whether through leisurely hobbies like gardening, participating in volunteer opportunities within local communities

"Cars provide us with convenience and mobility. However, their usage comes with several disadvantages. It is, therefore, necessary for us to limit car usage in order to enjoy several advantages. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages of limiting car usage and why it is important for our community.

Firstly, reducing car usage leads to improved air quality. Cars emit harmful substances like nitrogen oxide and particulate matter, which contribute to air pollution. Air pollution is a major concern as it can result in respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Limiting car usage reduces the amount of pollution in the environment, resulting in clean air.

Additionally, limiting car usage leads to reduced traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is a major issue in urban areas, leading to delays and increased travel time. When fewer cars are on the road, traffic flow improves and travel times are reduced. This results in less stress for commuters and less time wasted in traffic.

Furthermore, limiting car usage encourages people to adopt alternative modes of transportation such as walking and cycling. These alternatives promote physical activity and can help individuals lead a healthier lifestyle. They also contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gases and promote environmental sustainability.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is beneficial to society. It results in cleaner air, reduced traffic congestion, and improved physical and environmental health. We must take action by using cars only when necessary and adopting alternative modes of transportation. It is our responsibility to contribute to a sustainable and healthy community.",1
"The world today is grappling with the effects of climate change and global warming. Climate change threatens to disrupt ecosystems, increase food insecurity, displace people, and cause extreme weather events like wildfires and floods. The topic I will discuss in this essay looks specifically at how small-scale renewable energy sources can help reduce climate change’s negative impacts on individuals, communities and nations. Investing in renewable energy is becoming an increasingly viable way for individuals and households to generate their own electricity while also reducing their contribution to global carbon emissions. Renewable sources such as solar panels, wind turbines or hydroelectric dams are now being used by many homeowners as a means of generating power that does not use any fossil fuels nor emit any greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. In addition to providing clean electricity from these sustainable sources, technologies such as batteries can store excess power generated during peak hours so it can be used when needed later on in off-peak hours when demand is lower and commercial grid prices higher. This helps users avoid high electrical bills and potentially even save money over time. Beyond individual benefits for households however, investing in renewable energy production facilities has the potential to create economic opportunities for local populations through job creation or social benefit programs funded by profits made from selling surplus electricity back onto grids or through alternative channels like peer-to-peer trading networks between consumers directly owning renewable energy systems sharing their extra supply with each other without involving commercial entities at all. Additionally smaller scale investments could help rural areas become more energized as they often lack access to large centralized grids due to infrastructure costs involved making them difficult if not impossible locations for utility companies operating large polluting plants powered by traditional nonrenewable resources such as coal or oil accompanied by big transmission wires reaching far away cities where most of the profit lies instead leaving behind those who need it most out of reach of reliable affordable energy solutions causing poverty related health problems relating air pollution levels sometimes above legal limits set up intended protect human rights further endangering vulnerable

"I agree with this proverb because educating girls has a far-reaching impact that goes beyond the individual. When girls are educated, they are more likely to get married later, have fewer children, and be healthier overall. They are also more likely to earn an income and be less reliant on others. All of this has a positive ripple effect on families and communities.

For example, when girls get married later, they are more likely to finish school and delay having children. This gives them a better chance of finding a job and earning an income. They are also less likely to suffer from health problems related to early pregnancy and childbirth. As a result, they are better able to care for their own children and provide for their families.

In addition, educated girls are more likely to be aware of their rights and to stand up for themselves and their communities. They are less likely to tolerate domestic violence or other forms of abuse. They are also more likely to participate in decision-making and to be active citizens.

All of these factors contribute to a more stable and prosperous society. Educated girls are more likely to raise families that are healthy and financially secure. They are also more likely to be engaged citizens who contribute to the development of their communities.

In conclusion, I believe that the proverb is correct: educating girls has a far-reaching impact that goes beyond the individual. It is an investment in the future of families and communities.

When it comes to life advice, it is always wise to get opinions from multiple people. Drawing from a variety of sources and perspectives provides a robust set of ideas to consider and helps to ensure that no stone is left unturned. As an example, if you’re trying to make the important decision of whether to go back to school and pursue a new degree, consulting with your family, mentors, or friends can be helpful in understanding different angles and potential outcomes. 

Having multiple people weigh in on a decision can provide the support and confidence necessary to move forward; hearing different perspectives also reminds us to be flexible and to remain open to new possibilities, while keeping sight of our own personal values and goals. This is especially true in instances when a single opinion or valued opinion may not be sufficient. For example, if you are planning to make a career change you may need to talk to people who have successfully gone through the transition in order to recognize potential obstacles and create a realistic plan. 

Getting advice from multiple people allows us to benefit from everyone’s individual experiences, paving the way to a knighted path of informed decisions. All in all, leveraging feedback from multiple sources can be a rewarding and incredibly enriching venture on our life journeys.",1
"It is generally accepted that college and university instruction should be of the highest quality. To ensure that this is the case, some argue that faculty should be required to spend time working outside the academic world in professions relevant to the courses they teach. While this could be beneficial, I disagree with this requirement.

The primary reason for my disagreement is that this requirement would take too much time away from faculty, who need to focus on other important tasks within the academic world. College and university faculty are responsible for teaching classes, grading papers, holding office hours, and advising students. They are also expected to conduct research and publish papers. All of these tasks require a significant amount of time and effort, and forcing faculty to spend time outside the academic world would likely detract from their ability to fulfill all of these duties. Additionally, there is no guarantee that the profession chosen by the faculty member would be relevant to their courses. This could mean that the faculty member would be spending time in a profession that would not be beneficial towards their teaching. 

On the other hand, there are some potential benefits to this requirement. For one, faculty would gain a more comprehensive understanding of the field they are teaching. This could help faculty create more engaging and effective courses. Additionally, faculty could gain firsthand experience with the professional world, which could then be used to better prepare students for their future careers. Finally, faculty might gain valuable insight on the current trends and issues in the field, which could further improve the instruction they are providing.

Overall, while there are some potential benefits to requiring college and university faculty to spend time outside the academic world, I believe that this requirement would take too much time away from faculty, who have important tasks to complete within the academic world. Instead, faculty should be encouraged to spend time outside the academic world if they choose to do so, but this should not be a requirement. This would allow faculty to reap the potential benefits while still allowing them to maintain their core academic responsibilities.

"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage 

Limiting car usage can have a number of advantages for individuals and the community as a whole. The passage set provides evidence of this trend happening in different parts of the world, including Germany, France, and Colombia. In these places, efforts have been made to reduce the dependence on cars and promote alternative modes of transportation. Limiting car usage can lead to a cleaner environment, healthier individuals, and better community planning.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease the amount of pollution being released into the environment. This is particularly important in densely populated areas like cities, where air pollution can have severe health consequences for residents.

Additionally, limiting car usage can have positive impacts on individual health. The passage about the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, mentions that millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work on that particular day. Engaging in physical activity like walking or cycling instead of driving can help improve cardiovascular health and overall fitness. It can also reduce the risk of obesity and related diseases.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to better community planning and more efficient land use. The passage about Vauban, Germany, describes a community where street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden. Instead, emphasis is placed on public transportation and walking. This approach makes it easier for people to access amenities and services on foot and reduces the need for large parking lots and sprawling developments. Compact and walkable communities can promote social interaction, reduce traffic congestion, and improve quality of life.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have a range of advantages for both individuals and communities. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, promote physical activity and better health, and lead to more efficient community planning. As the passages suggest, these efforts are already being implemented in different parts of the world. It is important for individuals to consider alternative modes of transportation and make choices that contribute to a cleaner and healthier future.",1
"In recent years, the access to government proceedings on television has become more and more widespread. From trials to debates, meetings, and other important events, citizens can now tune in to view their government at work. Some people argue that this is a positive development for society since it helps people understand the issues that affect their lives. In this essay, I will argue that I fully agree with this statement.

To begin with, watching government proceedings on TV can help people stay informed about important issues that affect their lives. For instance, televised debates between political candidates can provide valuable information about their plans for the future. Citizens can then make informed decisions when they vote for their preferred candidate. Similarly, watching trials on TV can help people understand the legal process and the role of the judiciary in society. This can increase people's confidence in the legal system and promote a sense of justice.

Furthermore, televising government proceedings can promote transparency and accountability in government. When citizens can view proceedings such as legislative meetings, they can see how their representatives conduct themselves and how they make decisions. This can promote transparency and accountability in government, which is essential in a democracy. When people can see how their representatives vote on issues, they can hold them accountable for their actions. This can encourage politicians to act in the best interest of their constituents and not in their own interest.

In addition, televising government proceedings can promote civic engagement and participation. By viewing proceedings such as town hall meetings or public hearings, citizens can learn about issues that affect their community. They can then participate in the decision-making process and share their views with their representatives. This can promote a sense of civic engagement and encourage citizens to take an active role in shaping their communities.

Moreover, televising government proceedings can promote education and learning. By watching proceedings such as legislative debates or court trials, citizens can learn about the political and legal processes that shape their lives. This can increase their knowledge and understanding of how government works and their role in it. This knowledge can be empowering and can motivate people to become more involved in their communities.

In conclusion, I believe that televising government proceedings is a positive development for society. By providing citizens with access to important events, such as trials, debates, and meetings, people can stay informed about the issues that affect their lives. Furthermore, televising these events can promote transparency, accountability, civic engagement, and education. These are essential values in a democracy and can help promote a more engaged and informed citizenry.

"Drivers Should Not Use Cell Phones in Any Capacity While Operating a Vehicle

In today's world, the majority of people rely heavily on their cell phones to stay connected. However, using a cell phone while driving has become a serious safety hazard. There are several compelling reasons why drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity when operating a vehicle.

The main concern is that cell phone use greatly distracts drivers from focusing fully on the road. Whether talking, texting, or using apps, a driver's attention is drawn away from their primary task of safely navigating traffic. Numerous studies have shown that even hands-free use of cell phones leads to distracted driving. Our brains can only focus on one task at a time, so any cell phone interaction divides a driver's attention between conversing and driving. This puts not only the driver but also other motorists and pedestrians at risk.

Moreover, research shows that driving while distracted by a cell phone reduces reaction times as much as having a blood alcohol content at the legal limit of intoxication. Sending or reading a text takes a driver's eyes off the road for approximately five seconds. At 55 mph, that's enough time to cover the length of a football field without looking at the roadway. These kinds of distractions exponentially increase the chances of an accident from occurring. 

Finally, allowing any cell phone use encourages dangerous behaviors that are difficult to enforce. Even call-free modes like hands-free can still distract many drivers. Moreover, it may be challenging for law enforcement to determine if a driver was talking versus texting if an accident happens. A total ban on cell phone use provides a clear, blanket rule that is unambiguous and easier for police to enforce.

In conclusion, the serious safety hazards of distracted driving necessitate a complete ban on cell phone use behind the wheel. Driving requires full attention, and anything that takes a person's eyes and mind off the road should be prohibited to keep all travelers safe. The responsibility of driving diligently outweighs any need or urge to use a phone while in control of a potentially lethal moving vehicle.",1

Studying and gaining new information and skills is essential for future job prospects. Attending classes, either in person or online, can expand one's knowledge of the latest trends in their respective field. While there are numerous benefits to attending classes, there are also potential challenges students may face depending on their location and resources available. For instance, if distance is an issue, attending a physical class may be difficult. Alternatively, students with access to technology may find that online classes provide greater flexibility. Moreover, different opportunities are available to students depending on their prior educational experience and skills attained. For example, some may benefit more from college courses while others may receive greater benefit from vocational classes. In sum, by researching and understanding the benefits and challenges of attending classes, a student can take advantage of available educational opportunities to benefit their future job prospects.",1

Starting a career at a young age can be both beneficial and detrimental to the individual. Students who have taken career classes at a young age have had mixed experiences, although some have reaped great success. However, embarking on a career too soon can possibly backfire, with students quitting courses and wasting time on work that may not benefit them in the long run. Therefore, it is important for students to think carefully before diving headlong into their chosen career. It is wise to consider the best practices for those considering starting a career at an early age. Adequate preparation and research, understanding of relevant skills and qualifications, and finding balanced mentors are all critical elements that can help someone to plan out and thrive in their early career. Ultimately, embarking on a career at a young age can bring many rewards, but has potential risks which must be taken into account.",1
"There is a long-standing debate about whether children should learn to compete or cooperate. While some people believe that competition is essential for children to succeed in life, others argue that cooperation is more important. In my opinion, I believe that cooperation is a more valuable skill for children to learn than competition.

Firstly, cooperation teaches children to work together and build strong relationships. In today's world, success is not only about individual achievement but also about working effectively in teams. When children learn to cooperate, they learn to share ideas, listen to others, and compromise. These skills are essential for success in the workplace and in personal relationships.

Secondly, cooperation fosters a sense of community and empathy. When children learn to work together, they develop a sense of belonging and become more aware of the needs of others. They learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of others and become more accepting of diversity. This helps them to become more empathetic and compassionate individuals.

On the other hand, competition can be detrimental to children's development. It can create a sense of rivalry and hostility that can damage relationships and self-esteem. When children are taught to compete, they may become overly focused on winning and lose sight of the value of the process. This can lead to a lack of motivation and burnout.

Furthermore, competition can also create a sense of entitlement and selfishness. When children are taught that winning is everything, they may become more concerned with their own success rather than the success of the group. This can lead to a lack of empathy and a disregard for the needs of others.

In conclusion, while competition may have some benefits, I believe that cooperation is a more valuable skill for children to learn. Cooperation teaches children to work together, build relationships, and develop empathy. These skills are essential for success in the workplace and in personal relationships. Therefore, it is important for parents and educators to prioritize cooperation over competition when teaching children.

"There are a number of factors that contribute to the stress that people feel at work. Long hours, demanding bosses, and unrealistic deadlines can all lead to a feeling of being overwhelmed. However, it is important to remember that work has always been a source of stress for many people. In the past, people worked long hours in difficult conditions with little opportunity for leisure time. Today, while work may be more demanding in some ways, it is also more likely to offer opportunities for leisure time and flexible working conditions.

One of the most important things to remember when considering stress at work is that it is often relative. What one person finds stressful, another may find manageable. For example, someone who works in a high-pressure job may find that they are able to cope with the stress because they have a good support network at work. On the other hand, someone who works in a job that they find boring or unchallenging may find that the lack of stimulation leads to feelings of stress.

It is also important to remember that stress is not always a bad thing. A certain amount of stress can be motivating and can help people to focus on their work. It is only when the stress becomes excessive that it can lead to problems.

In conclusion, while work can be a source of stress for many people, it is important to remember that this has always been the case. What is important is how we deal with the stress. If we are able to find ways to manage our stress levels, then we can still enjoy our work and lead productive and fulfilling lives.

First impressions are incredibly important, and our initial encounters with people, ideas, and experiences will often set the tone for our future relationships. Our snap judgement of something or someone can impact us for the long haul, and this is especially true when it comes to forming lasting impressions of people. Whether we realize it or not, our initial impressions have a powerful impact on our relationships with other people. 

For instance, let’s suppose that you are starting at a new school and you have your first encounter with the principal. If that first meeting goes well, chances are you will have a good attitude about this person and feel respected and welcomed. However, if your first meeting with the principal is unpleasant, you are likely to treat them with distrust and antipathy, and it could color the way you view them for a long time. 

Additionally, our first impressions can determine how we look at the world. When we realize that our instinctive knee-jerk reactions and gut feelings about people and situations should be taken seriously, we realize how much of an impact they can have on our lives. To illustrate this point, let’s say that you walk into a party and you are immediately met with a feeling of warmth and acceptance. This can help to shape the way you feel about the world and can impact the way you interact with the people you meet from then on. On the other hand, if the party is less than hospitable, that can lead you to believe in a more hostile view of the world. 

From these examples, it is clear that our first impressions can be incredibly powerful and can have a long lasting impact on our lives. It is essential to pay close attention to these initial reactions and work to make sure that they are as positive as possible. By doing so, we can ensure that our relationships with people, and our outlook on life, remain healthy and upbeat.",1
"The Impact of Single-Use Plastic on Marine Life. Single-use plastics have had a devastating impact on marine life and their habitats all over the world. This type of plastic, which is designed to be used once before being thrown away, has become ubiquitous in recent years due to its convenience and low cost. Unfortunately, this means that it is often not properly disposed of or recycled - instead ending up in oceans and other bodies of water where it can cause significant harm to wildlife. One major issue posed by single-use plastic is the sheer amount that ends up polluting waterways around the world. Studies suggest that as much as 8 million metric tons are dumped into our oceans annually - an alarming statistic considering how long most types take to decompose naturally. As the material breaks down over time into microplastics, they can sink lower into food chains where they are consumed by unsuspecting fish species and other sea creatures, leading to a range of digestive issues at best or death at worst. In addition, larger pieces can also cause physical injury if ingested or tangled around parts such as fins or flippers while others block sunlight from reaching vulnerable coral reefs below them; either way impacting overall population health in a given area. . . Beyond this direct harm however is something perhaps more sinister: The effect all this human waste has on entire ecosystems across vast regions of Earth’s waters. For example areas like Hawaii’s Great Pacific Garbage Patch contain large concentrations of plastics (and other debris) so dense that marine life finds themselves unable to swim through these regions due to entanglement with items such as six pack rings; preventing them from carrying out everyday tasks like foraging for food elsewhere – thus affecting whole populations within a short period!. Additionally when currents move trash from one area another problem arises: Pollutant matter enters new locations with unknown consequences on already fragile environments and communities therein who must now cope with yet another man made obstacle to their survival - creating

"In today's world, advertising has become an essential part of our lives. It is everywhere - on television, billboards, magazines, and social media. The primary purpose of advertising is to promote and sell products, and one way to achieve this goal is by making consumers aspire to be like the person in the ad. This strategy is effective because it not only sells products but also helps people feel better about themselves. In my opinion, I agree with this statement, and in this essay, I will provide specific examples to support my argument.

Firstly, advertisements often use attractive models or celebrities to promote their products. For example, a famous actress promoting a particular brand of shampoo will make consumers associate the brand with beauty and glamour. This association, in turn, will make consumers aspire to be like the actress and purchase the product to achieve the same look. This strategy is effective because it taps into people's desire to be like their idols and reinforces the belief that using the product will make them more like the celebrity in the ad.

Secondly, advertisements use social proof to make people want to buy their products. Social proof refers to the psychological phenomenon where people are more likely to do something if they see others doing it. For example, an advertisement for a new smartphone will show a group of people using the phone and enjoying it's features. This association will make consumers want to be part of the group and enjoy the same benefits. This strategy is effective because it taps into people's need to belong and reinforces the belief that using the product will make them part of a desirable group.

Thirdly, advertisements often use emotional appeals to make people want to buy their products. Emotional appeals refer to the use of emotions such as happiness, sadness, or fear to influence people's behavior. For example, an advertisement for a luxury car will show a successful businessman driving the car and feeling confident and powerful. This association will make consumers want to feel the same way and purchase the car to achieve the same status. This strategy is effective because it taps into people's desire for emotional fulfillment and reinforces the belief that using the product will make them feel better about themselves.

In conclusion, the purpose of many advertisements is to make consumers want to buy a product so that they will 'be like' the person in the ad. This practice is effective because it not only sells products but also helps people feel better about themselves. Advertisements use attractive models or celebrities, social proof, and emotional appeals to influence people's behavior. These strategies tap into people's desire to be like their idols, to belong to a desirable group, and to achieve emotional fulfillment. Therefore, advertising has become an essential part of our lives and will continue to be so in the future.

"Ads that promise ""the best of the best"" can be deceiving. Many of the products advertised as the bestsellers on the market are actually very poor quality. For example, many people believe that the ""mirrorless camera"" is the best camera ever made, when in reality the camera is very difficult to use and often does not perform as well as other models. 

Another common mistake is thinking that a product is ""the best of the best"" when it is not. For example, people often believe that the ""best car"" is the one that is the most expensive, when in fact the best car can be very affordable. 

When it comes to products, it is important to make sure that the information that is being given is true. For example, many people believe that the ""best"" hearing aids are the ones that are the most expensive, when in reality the best hearing aids can be very affordable. Advertisments can be deceiving, but it is important to be aware of what is being advertised and to do your research.

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the Electoral College system for selecting the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I have carefully considered the arguments presented both in favor of keeping the current system and changing to a popular vote. After analyzing the information from multiple sources, I firmly believe that the Electoral College system should be retained for the following reasons.

Firstly, the certainty of outcome provided by the Electoral College is crucial in ensuring a smooth and clear election process. While disputes over the outcome of electoral votes are possible, they are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. This is mainly because the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote. Moreover, the winner-take-all method in most states creates a landslide victory for the candidate with even a slight plurality, minimizing the chances of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of a president who represents the interests of the entire nation. The requirement for a candidate to have trans-regional appeal ensures that no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This prevents a candidate with only regional support from becoming president and neglecting the interests of other regions. It fosters a sense of inclusivity and avoids the perception of disenfranchisement among voters in states with fewer electoral votes.

Furthermore, the focus on swing states incentivizes candidates to campaign extensively in those states. This means that voters in swing states have a greater chance of engaging with and critically evaluating the different candidates. These voters are likely to be the most informed and thoughtful, making them the ideal group to decide the outcome of the election. By directing campaign efforts towards swing states, the Electoral College system promotes a more informed electorate.

In addition, the Electoral College balances the political importance of large and small states. While large states may lose some weight in the political balance due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate, the Electoral College system ensures that candidates pay attention to and campaign in all states, regardless of their size. Small states are not marginalized, as victories with even a small margin in those states still contribute to the overall electoral vote count, giving them a voice in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College helps avoid the need for run-off elections, which can complicate the electoral process. By invariably producing a clear winner, it ensures a decisive outcome that avoids prolonged election disputes or the need for additional rounds of voting. This streamlines the process and provides stability in electing the president.

While some argue against the Electoral College, claiming it is unfair, outdated, and irrational, the practical reasons to retain it far outweigh these assertions. The current system has been effective in ensuring certainty, broader representation, informed voting, fair political balance, and avoiding run-off elections. These benefits are vital in maintaining a functioning democratic process in the United States.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important issue. I trust that you will carefully weigh the arguments for and against the Electoral College system before making any decisions. It is my hope that you will support the continuation of this vital process that has served our democracy well for over two centuries.

Yours sincerely,

"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: Lessons from Global Communities 

The twenty-first century has brought about countless advancements, but one of the most substantial societal shifts is the reduction of car usage across the globe. This trending decrease emphasizes the significance and benefits of shifting towards sustainable alternatives, contributing to cleaner air, quieter neighborhoods, and a shift towards community-focused planning and design. Analyzing several international examples such as Vauban, Germany; Paris, France; Bogota, Colombia; and even patterns developing in the United States, will provide clear insight into this trend's multiple advantages.

Vauban, Germany forefronts this movement. As described by Rosenthal (2009), Vauban residents have largely given up their cars leading to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, a common environmental concern. What is even more fascinating about Vauban, and other similar communities across the globe, is the shift in urban planning. The community design encourages car owners to park at the outskirts of town, promoting walking and cycling, consequently lessening environmental impact and fostering physical health and community engagement (Rosenthal, 2009).

Paris, also facing the challenge of pollution, implemented a partial driving ban, significantly reducing congestion and improving air quality (Duffer, 2014). Similarly, Bogota, Colombia challenges its residents to a annual car-free day, promoting the use of bicycles, public transportation, or simply walking, leading to quieter streets and cleaner air (Selsky, 2002). These examples prove that alternatives exist and can be applied effectively if communities commit to change.

Furthermore, the shift towards limiting car usage is not exclusive to small communities or cities in Europe or South America. The United States, the birthplace of the Model T and home to vast suburban sprawls dependent on cars, is also displaying a shift. Researchers suggest that Americans are gradually buying fewer cars, driving less, and obtaining fewer licenses (Rosenthal, 2013). Rates of car ownership have decreased, and the younger generation seems less interested in owning cars. The implications of such are beneficial for the environment, as transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions (Rosenthal, 2013).

This cultural shift holds potential in tackling environmental problems while encouraging healthier, community-centric lifestyle choices. Attitudes towards car ownership are changing. People are prioritizing public transportation, walking, cycling, and even telecommuting. The advent of car-sharing programs, bike-sharing initiatives, and increase use of carpooling apps, all signify a greater societal shift in our approach to transportation (Rosenthal, 2013).

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers a plethora of benefits, based on demonstrative global examples. A decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, the fostering of community interactions, the encouragement of healthier routines, and even shifts in urban planning designs all lead to more sustainable and socially-amicable environments. As we continue to rebuild and redefine our communities, it's vital to recognize the benefits of reducing car usage and truly consider the potential of more sustainable alternatives.

"Has there ever been a time in your life when you didn't know what to do and needed advice? When you asked someone something did you only ask that person or multiple people? There are some people that only ask one person. But I will explain why asking multiple people is better than asking one specific person. That is because getting different point of views allow different feelings and understandings, you find out things you never knew,and you get to learn about that person.

My first reason, is you get to see different point of views which allow you to feel and understand that person better. Different point of views help some people get through things and helps others get to the right place. As you learn it makes you want more to learn. But learning that much takes time.

The next reason, you find out things you never knew. Finding out new things can be scary as well as exciting, but that is a part of different views. Some people hate finding out new things because their scared of what is is. An example is if a family of four found out that their mom has a third child the family would be devastated at the fact of another child they knew nothing about. But there are just somethings people have to learn to except.

The last reason, you get to learn about that person. Learning about new people is always exciting. You can make new friends, and your friends can meet new friends. But meeting new people is still hard because you don't anything about them. Also when you try to learn about them they can get defensive. Some people hate their past, but they need new people to be friends with to forget about their past.

The conclusion of this is different point of views can help people in a lot of ways. You can meet new people, find out things you never knew. But the important thing is how you can see different point if views for advice. And advice from more than one person is a good thing. So make sure to ask multiple people about something to get different angles of that thing",0
"In the United States, democracy is advertised as a method of acheiving selections, though this is unfortunantly not the case. In the United States, we, as individuals, are not permitted to a ""fair"" or equal opportunity of voting systems. Vote should be popular, the will of the people of the nation, though through the Electoral College, the people is denied.

Voting is, as far as common sense goes, the majority rule. The Electoral College voting system was established during the creation of the Constitution in order to secure a ""qualified vote""- an effort to diminish the will of the lesser, or unknowing. Arguably, it is stated that, ""..the most thoughful voters should be the ones to decide the election"", or in other words the statement can easily be translated to ""we do not wish a nation of idiotic voters to decide our president"", each individual of the nation is mindful of others and care enough to express their opinion, as it is known a is a citizens duty to vote. A duty that must be followed. In any effort to simplify this, a voter is a voter. They are all ""qualified"". If a person cares enough about their nation to cast a ballot, without requirment, they certainly are qualified.

Now that the qualifications are established, the electors within the Electoral College are free to do as they wish. Waving a magic wand, the support of others is unimportant now, and they pull whatever they desire out of the hat, as written by Bradford Plumer, ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsiblefor picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people"". What happened to majority rule? People should have the direct vote of presidential candidate, however we are faced with shocking facts such as the house selection rarely dispalying the correct majority rule, ""The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe"".

The dispicable system was established long ago for an extremely specific purpose with specific issues, which is no longer the case today. In the United States, we are not a democracy. We are a Republic. Ridiculusly, voters do not control the election in our Republic, as shared,""...over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election"". Can those expect change? Ironically, no. The system would most like not allow that, and those mindful citizens would need to hope for a glance at serendipity.",0
"Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Many people also drive a vehicle. When these two things are combined, they can be very hazardous to someone's life. Here are some reasons why you should not use a cell phone and operate a vehicle.

The main reason why you shouldn't use a phone while driving is because it is a distraction. The National Safety Council says that using a cell phone while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. People are often hit or run over by a car only because the drive was looking at their phone. So many accidents are caused by cell phone use, because when you are looking at the phone; you are not looking at the road.

There are numerous ways to prevent car accidents caused by cell phone use. Children need to be taught the dangers of using a phone and driving. In Georgia we have a law that says, ""You have to have your phone in a cell phone holder while driving,"" if more states would do this we would be golden. And finally, you can use a Bluetooth earpiece, so you don't have to pick up or look at your phone to answer it. We know how to stop so why don't we stop it already.

When it comes down to it, using a cell phone while driving is one of the most dangerous things someone can do. When you're doing something as difficult as driving a car, the last thing you need is something to distract you. Preventing it is the best thing we can do right now. My grandma always tells me, ""When it comes to a cell phone, just remember that no matter what it is, it can wait.""",0
"Phones and Driving

Have you ever wondered about the dangers of operating a phone while driving? Should people be able to use a phone while driving a car? Will there be a future of using phone while driving? There is a great percentage of drivers that use their phones while driving a car. With many opportunities to use a phone while stopped at a red light or stuck in traffic, phones have been a danger to many people. Not being able to use a phone while driving a car is true because of distractions and car crashes.

Using a phone while driving a car is very dangerous. Most car crashes are caused by drivers scrolling through social media, taking pictures, looking at navigation, or searching for music (Evans Moore). Edgar Snyder & Associates states that ""There are about 1.6 million car crashes a year just because the driver is using their phone."" Those car crashes that occurred are all because of drivers attempting to use their phones. Our smartphones are a great resource to have and use but are a major risk to our lives if used at a wrong time and place. Phones should be used before starting the car and used after getting to the desired destination. Drivers should not be able to use a phone while operating a car because they are a distraction and causes many car crashes.

In my personal opinion I don't think people should be able to use a cellphone while operating a car. There are many people lives at stake because of reckless drivers. ""According to the report, cell phones caused 26 percent of car accidents in the U.S. in 2014. Text messaging causes 5 percent of crashes (Bey & Associates)"". Using the phone makes the driver's main focus go from driving to what is on the screen. The reckless drivers cause car accidents and that can cause major injuries. Some of those injuries can cause permanent damage while others are small injuries.

I am pretty positive that there would be a future of using phones and driving. Even though there are many laws that say using a phone while operating a car isn't allowed people still do it on a daily. There are many states that have already banned the usage of phones while driving. ""18 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands prohibit all drivers from using hand-held cell phones while driving. All are primary enforcement laws-an officer may cite a driver for using a hand-held cell phone without any other traffic offense taking place (GHSA)."" There are always those who use their phone while driving, but they should be punished for their recklessness.

There would always be a danger to driving and using a phone. The drivers that look at their phones now are already a danger. With the next generation starting to drive there would be an even bigger percentage of accidents. Those who choose to use the phone while driving should suffer the consequences.

"Facial Action Coding at schools?

Class rooms with , Facial Action Coding , ? I think for a classroom with Facial Action Coding would not be such a good idea in a classroom. There are many reasons why it's not a good idea. There are many emotions in a student in a class room that a student wouldn't want to be recogize . For many student there always someone who is in love and does not want anyone to figure it out . In paragrahp 3 it tells readers that "" happiness, surpise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"" can all be shown with the Facial Action Coding System. The student might be sad because the girl wouldn't go out on a date with him and show that emotion in class.

For many students I honstley think alot of students would not like it . Another reason why it would not be a good idea to put this new Facial Action Coding System in many classroom is it might distract many of the students. Alot of classroom students are already going through alot of things like stressing, grades, finals, and credits. They wouldn't want that to be pick up by the system for a example a student could be really sad about his grades and doen't want anyone to know. Our minds are only safe place to go where anyone can't go.

Other places would be a better option for the Facial Action Coding like hostiptals and nursing homes. A good reason why I think it would be a good idea at a hostpital because it can help alot of people that are sick and feeling pain. In paragraph 3 it say the system can pick up happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. At a hostpital a patient could be help out with the machine and tell if she or he is sad or happy. At a nursing home he can help out the the old folks by making sure that there not depressed or angry.

What if the Facial Action Cding system shows that 50% percent of the student show that they really get the work. And the other 50% percent do not get the work what would the teacher do? Would the teacher choice be right to choose to get the same work where the 50% percent doesn't understand it and give the same work to the other 50% percent of the class that already knows how to solve the work. I think it not a good idea for classrooms to have Facial Action Coding System at schools.

At schools it might not be a good idea and might be better in many other places. For many students it coulld distract them or if other dont want to show emotions because of there personal thoughts being shown to teachers. Would you want schools to have this new Facial Action Coding System at there school and on computers?",0
"The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" talks about new software created by Thomas Huag, who studies Advanced Science at the University of Amsterdam along side his colleague Dr. Huang. They are both experts at coming up with better ways for humans and computers to communicate. That is excatly what this new invention is about. The invention they created is used to help recognize not only humans emotions but paintings' emotions as well. Leonardo da Vinci's famous painting the ""Mona Lisa""

is the subject of this particular experiment. Both scientists were succesful in finding out what were her actual feelings behind her smile. This invention would also be valuable for students in a classroom.

The author writes in the six paragraph ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". The author continues to elaborate and says that then the lesson would be modified. Modifying the lesson can mean that the teacher changes their teaching plan to fit the students understanding. Having this new innovation will make students smarter and get higher test grades, because they will be learning at their own pace and level, thus helping them understand the work better.

This invention could also be essential for everyday human interactions as well since most of us communicate through a nonverbal launguage, this inventions would help us humans eachother better. Better communication leads to a lot of positivity in the world such as, less wars because we would be getting along better and understandandng eachother better.

Overall this new invention would be very essential to use in a classroom for many reasons. It helps students understand the lesson more. Understanding is key for better test grades.",0
"The arts of technology. I think it is safe to say that technology has expanded over time. We live in a world where kids and even adults have technology. It is a part of our socitey now, but remember how hundreds of years ago we did not have technolgy and we did just fine? How we showed emotions throught our and nothing else and now days we have emoticans and what not?

Now we have a computer that reads us. How weird is that? We did not need this but now we seem to have. Kids now days email their teacher in order to get help when not so long ago we had Saturday school to tutor those that needed help. This computer is going to help teacher supposedly read tyhe face expression children make has they are exlaining the lesson. That way they can go back and see who makes expression of confusion and does not.

This will help those kids that are to afraid to say thye need help. See a childs ego can be pretty big when it comes to their education believe it or not. A kid could be too afraid to ask for help because they have a feeling they can do it on their own. The computer target each motion the face makes or when ever a muscle is different or changes in a face. A teacher/studenet relationship is now going to followed up by a computer screen. Won't be long untill the robots take over.

This computer program will probably make it easy for other people to see how they feel towards one another. Maybe some will like the answer and other will not. See thing about this is that maybe the computer will ditect a feeling that the person will not be sharing at all or does not want people to know about this feeling. It could be invady some privacy because this person mught be hdidng a feeling thay do not want show, This computer will read that due to the face muscles he/she will be moving. Whoever reads the results of this person will find themselve in a position they will not knnow what to do.

Maybe this computer program is good for somethings, but in some ocasions it will not be a good source. Also this computer program alterates more the usage of technolgy these days. This will make society more intense and more into technology then what it already is. People should be able to show and tell their emotions if they feel free to. Not by a computer to tell them for them!",0
"You get upearly on November 6, 2012 ready to vote, because every vote counts! But does it really? Instead  of your vote going directly towards who you want as president, it goes towards the electoral collge and then they decide who really wins the presidency. The Electoral College ia a system where instead of the people vote for the president, a group of electors choose the next leader of the free world. I fervently believe that we should abolish the Eletoral College sytem, and change the election of popular ovte because it is an injustice, outdated, and irrational.

The Electoral College system is highly unfair. The voters wnat to elect the president that they would like, and in order to do that their vote should be significant. Although  the Electoral Collge system is at times efficent, it still does not satisify the voters. The people aren't even the ones who get an actual say on who their next president will be. Even the people who are in defense of the Electoral College System agree, ""It is the electors who elect the president, not the people"" (15), says Richard A. Posner author of ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing president."" In the 2000 elections, candidate Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush, and won the popular vote, but did not win the electoral college vote so he lost the presidency. If this is supposedly a ""free"" country with a democratic system, then shouldn't the citizens have the right to pick the individual that will be running their country for the next four years?

Some electors may not even vote with the majority. Voters can't control who their electors vote for. The electors are even sometimes picked by the presidential candidate running for office, how does it seem fair that a group of people that hold the fate of our country in their hands is chosen by soemone who would be highly affected by their decision.

It is also an injustce because of the way the votes count. If you live in a state with a higher population, your state gets more electoral votes. The amount of electors depends on the amount of senators and representatives your state has. There is one elector per representative, and two per senator. There is a total of 538 electors, and to win presidency the candidate mst have at least 270 or higher. For example sya you live in Iowa, where there are only four electors, the vote doesn't count as much as the votes in California or Florida.  The system is completely outdated too. The Electoral College system has been around for hundreds of yars,a dn it is not up to date with our modern times, so it is a complete waste to use it.",0
The face on Mars has a lot of people thinking there is life there but studies show there is no sign of life on Mars. The face on mars is very big so people dont really think it was made by aliens. Just because it big that doesnt make it made by aliens but in outer space there are a lot of astroides flying around so some of them may have hit a mound of rock to where it has made a face. People still want to believe that there is life out in space there could be but there are no studys to prove that there is life. In conclusion there is not lif on mars and that face could have been made naturally because how long has the face been there before we took the picture. There could have been someway that the face was formed. Look at Earth there are many formations that have been naturally made. There are other studies that the ice caps on Mars have tiny bugs in them.,0
"In German suburb, this is a ""car-free"" place, this may seem shocking to many for people who use cars to go where they need to everyday...  Car ownership is only allowed in two places; large parking garages at the edge of development, where a car owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.  Some say that it's good for the earth due to the bad pollution.  As I move along I will give some of my honest opinnion and some opinions of others.

Some countries around the world is trying to put an end to polluting the earth and one of the ways they did that was to ban driving cars.  People would think that as crazy but it is actually a brilliant idea because it would lessen the Ozone whole that is being crerated by polluting.  We actaully need this Ozone hole to protect us from the dangerous sun rays.  Another reason why they are putting an end to cars is the dangerous smogs that have been filling the cities.

My honest opinions on this subject matter is I think it's creative in a way but I don't like it just because of how much I have to travel everyday.  First I go to school of course, then I go home then I drive to practice which is a 30 minute drive, that also means driving all the way home too.  I also think this is creative in some ways because first it saves gas money since gas prices are going up soon due to economy.  Second of all it help lessen the pollution we are doing to the earth.

Some other people have writen their own opinions on this ""car-banning"" process.  A mother of two who is also a media trainer name Heidrun Walter gave her honest opinion of this ""car-banning"".  ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.""  Another man name David Gold berg, an offical of Transportation for America said ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change.

Although our development is changing it may have a good effective role on our earth.  Ask yourself next time is it really worth the drive?",0
"I do not think that the use of this technology in a classroom is valuable. I think the use of this technology is pointless and a waste of money, in a classroom atleast.

One reason I do not agree with the use of this computer software in a classroom is because the software doesn't understand everything that we are feeling inside. People don't always put on a face when they are feeling some type of emotion, rather they can just sit there expressionless and still feel angry, sad, or happy. I do not think this software is advanced or accurate enough to tell what we're feeling.

Another reason I find this software useless in a classroom is about learning cirriculum in the classroom. In the article it said that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"". How is the software supposed to know what we are learning, how we are supposed to learn about it, and how would the software modify the lesson to make it less confusing or more interesting? I think the software would be less useful than an actual human being teacher, because a teacher can explain and help you with something when you're confused, and not have to worry about modifying the lesson which could cause everyone to be at a different level of understanind of the lesson.

My final reason I do not agree with the use of this technology in a classroom is about the cost, and is it even nessasary? Since this software is new and advanced for facial coding, I would assume it would be very expensive. The use of this system to me, is just a waste of money, and is basically making teachers less useful and interactive with their students. A teacher is the one who should make decisions on how to teach a lesson or how to help a student, rather than a computer software that doesn't know what a person is thinking just because of their facial expression.

In conclusion I do not agree with using this technology in a classroom to help students with their learning. This software may be useful in other situations, but to me, in a classroom it is useless along with a waste of the schools money.",0
"""Hey Generic_Name are you going to the movies today?"" asked Generic_Name. ""Hmm I don't think so I have to go talk to my sister about something"" replied Generic_Name. It was the end of the school day, and Generic_Name's sister Generic_Name was going to pick her up from school. ""Hey kiddo how was your day?"" asked Generic_Name. It was okay I guess"" answered Generic_Name. Generic_Name asked Generic_Name, ""What's wrong?"" ""Look I was wondering if I can ask you something"" said Generic_Name. ""Sure what's going on?"" replied Generic_Name. ""So I wanted to go to the movies today but, I didn't want to go because Generic_Name was going to bring her new friends and, her friends are really mean to me and I don't want to tell her"" said Generic_Name. ""Look you have to tell her friends to back off and to leave you alone"" said Generic_Name in anger. For some people it's hard to make the right choice. Sometimes they don't know what to do so they ask for advice. When asking for advice to more than one person is helpful because you can see what people have to say to you advice, you can agree to some of the advice they have to give you, and some people might know the answer to your problem because they went through this situation.

To begin with most people have different opinions to people's problems, but that's a good thing because you can ask multiple people to your own problem. You can go and ask so many people and hear what they have to say. Everyone has different opinions which is good but you know a great thing about asking for advice is that you can choice which one you would take. An example to this is a kid named Generic_Name who as dealing with a big problem so his girlfriend was cheating on him, but he really didn't know what to do about it ,because he loved her so much. So he went off to ask so many people for their opinion about this. Generic_Name heard a lot of different things, he heard that he should stay with her and forget about what she did, to leave her and never talk to her, and just to talk to her and confront her. At the end of the day he knew what choice to pick because he heard many people's opinions, and he knew the right choice. This was just by hearing them, that's why you should listen to what people have to say.

Another problem that can help you when asking for advice is you can agree and disagree to what everyone has to say. That's the best thing if you don't agree with them you can say why you don't agree with them. Also its just not going to be disagreeing and agreeing with one person but multiple people. An example to this is Generic_Name who hate's helping her bullies with her homework. She always has to help her bullies with homework and she still hasn't told anyone about this problem. One day she wanted to tell someone so she told her mom, and she said that she should tell them to leave her alone, but if she did that they wouldn't stop. So she didnt like her mom's answer so she she asked her friend, Generic_Name and she said to not do anything and leave it alone. Generic_Name didn't like that answer too. She asked her grandma and she said to tell a teacher, this was the answer she knew she needed and she took her advice a went for it. Generic_Name told on them and they left her alone, she knew she made the right choice but she was disagreeing to some of the things that didn't sound right. This a great way to get you choice by agreeing and disagreeing tell you know which one is the right choice.

The last thing is asking multiple people for advice is good because if you ask people for help they might of had this problem too. It's good to see people had the same problem as you and they can help you. A reason to this is Generic_Name who had a problem to when she had a friend talking behind her back and still hanging out with her was a issue she had. She knew she had to tell someone, she told her mom, her aunt, her grandma, and her sister. Generic_Name asked all of them and none of them had this problem expect her sister. She was taking to her what happen and how it ended. Generic_Name was happy that she knew what to do because someone went through this. So what she had to do was tell her that she doesn't wasnt a friend who lies to her and talks behind her back. She said this and never talked to her again which was said but she knew what to do because someone went thought this, it helped her a lot.

""Hey Generic_Name can I talk to you for a little bit about something"" asked Generic_Name. Generic_Name replied ""Sure what's up."" ""So your friends have been taking bad about me and I don't like that, your friends are so mean to I dont know how you like them."" said Generic_Name. ""Oh I didn't know that I thought that they like you it"" replied Generic_Name. ""Um they don't but I don't want hang out with them just you like we use to"" said Generic_Name. ""Me too I don't even like them too, thank you for telling me"" said Generic_Name. ""Yeah me too"" said Generic_Name. ""Um why did it take you so long to tell me"" asked Generic_Name. ""I needed to know how to tell you so I asked helped for many people"" answered Generic_Name. When asking for advice from multiple people is helpful that's why we should ask for help when we need it. It's okay to ask more than one person it helps a lot, just how it helped Generic_Name.",0

RE: Classes online

Not bacause I take classes online many of the students will not be responsible and they miss many grades, They will even have not internet in online classes for be doing their own things at home for example, if i have online classes i would be distranted by my brother or other things and i feel that my online classes is not would not be good idea like i say that online class is not a good idea there are many distraction. also, if we have that problem I think that beging with teachers is the best idea cause they help us a lot in the amies.

The firs reason is not all student have the internet in the houses some students don't have the internet because their parents don't have too much money to but one or maybe because they don't have the tecnology. One friend told me that their parents think that the tecnology is bad for him because it is distraction and he needs to focus on his future. and if he dosen't take that class online he will fall that class. every parents think different.

Another reason because not all student are not responsibles. some student came to school but they don't do anything' but it the teacher letf them that they need to do this, they do it, because they feel pressure and they know that the fall the class but is their class is online they will no care about the class, And they don't will take care about the class.

The conclusion is tha bad idea take classes online because the internet is one of the things that they need it, anbd not all the students have it, they need to have their responsability the class and not to all the student care for their classes, and the last thing is because not al the students like to have classes online because they know that they can't consentrate in their house bacause all the noise around.

"Cars are beginig to come to be a big issue. They are causing so many disadvantages to overpopulated and average populated areas of the world. If the amounts of cars being driven/owned reduces we will come to plenty of advantages in manys ways. Human Health, abilities, and living spaces will all benefit from being car free !

Less cars makes the area less compacted which allows more space for side walks and walk ways to be built into the small town that have a high population. Places such as VAUBAN Germany and French and Swiss borders and many other places will have noo street parking, driveways and home garages. Without all of the car infested thing such as spoken there will be appropiate space and routes for public transportation and makes things and place s more accessible. Instaed of having a mall along side a distant highway it can have walk ways and more space for shopping centers and people to come not having to worry about having to find a space to park or any other conflict we all would run into reguarding personally owned vehicles. Not mentioning many more abilities that will come to hand when we become car free. Becomming car free environments is a very important task also for health reasons of everyone. Riding bikes, hiking, and walking will all come a part of everyones daily activity if not while being publically transported.. Smog is also a big issue hear, agreed? For example, in Paris, there smog percentage went down 60% because they are going through the process of limiting ownership of cars.

It is guarenteed that we will benefit from being car free. Less hassal, large decrease in accidents of vehicles and in health of all around. it is a big change but but an even larger advantage.",0
"Different Forms of Advice

Sometimes I ask different people for advice such as my friends, my family, and my teachers but that does not mean I am trying to be rude it just mean that I am getting different responses. When people ask for advice and they multiple people they are just trying to seek different opinions than what you gave them. They are trying to find a clearer answer, a different response, and a more reasonable response. People are trying to reevaluate their opinions that they have heard fro possibly better opinions. Sometimes people like to seek different responses because they could have not liked the previous response or they just want to hear a different persons advice. Another reason for seek different advice is because they want to make sure that they are making the right decisions.

Reasons to ask for different advice from different people is because they want to find a clearer form of advice they understand. A reason for this is because they would like to make sure they do not make the same mistake so when they seek others advice if they do not understand it they are going to keep asking until they find clearer answers. Another reason for trying to find a clearer answer is because they probably did not hear them so how are you going to go by their advice if you could not understand them

Also you could ask them to repeat what they said but sometimes people do not like to be bothered so you could just ask a different person and get their advice. Last reason you could ask for a second opinion for a clearer reasoning is when you are asking people sometimes the person you are asking does not want to be talked to because he is having a bad day or something, so you have to move on to another person until you find someone that actually likes company and would not mind giving you advice.

Secondly reasons for wanting to ask another peer is because they would like to hear something different and something that they have already heard. They could want some different advice because they could have already heard somebody say what you have said but they want some more advice so they have different things to look forward to. Another reason is because they would like to have different forms of advice because the could have wanted a specific form of advice but they ended up hearing other reasons and opinions on what they should do and you have more forms of advice to think about. Other reasons for wanting to hear different advice is because they want to listen and hear what other people have to say that is different but about the same topic. My last reason is because they normally hear advice just to hear it from one person but when you ask multiple people you hear multiple types of reasons on why you should or why you should not.

Lastly people ask different people for advice on the same topic because they are trying to find a more reasonable opinion on why they should or why they should not. The reason for wanting to get a more reasonable opinion is because if you hear something that you know is impossible you want hear something that sounds a little more manageable or at least a little easier and doesn not take that long to do. My second reason for getting a more reasonable response is because you could want to do something a little easier to do or not as hard so you go for the easier ones so you can get them done faster. My third reason for want a reasonable response is because you could have wanted to do something or hear something that sounds really reasonable to you so you would like to hear it from somebody so you go and ask to see if anybody think it is as reasonable as you do.

When people ask for advice and they multiple people they are just trying to seek different opinions than what you gave them. They are trying to find a clearer answer, a different response, and a more reasonable response. and the reasons for my reasons are in the text so read if you want to understand why. Another reason for all of that is to find ways to do something without doing something bad or wrong.",0
"Cars are not the most important thing in our lives. Although cars are helpful, not having one can help you a lot in the long run. Having a car causes so much stress worrying about the traffic if you're going to be late for work or school, gas prices are not as low as people would like. If you had to walk everywhere or ride your bike, you could be getting a lot of exercise from it. People think having a car is so important but they dont see the positive side to it.

Many people stress out if they are not going to make it to work on time because of traffic, I know that I dont make it to school on time because of all the traffic trying to get into my school is horrible. Instead of stressing out, you can just go on a calm walk or bike ride to your destination. In the article written by, Elisabeth Rosenthal, there is a quote from Heidrun Walter saying, ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" because they had banned cars in his city. You can always find an alternative way of getting to where you need to go. If someone has a meeting to go to, they can always use the alternative of the Internet if they cant get their in time or the weather is not the best. Instead of stressing out about driving, you can walk to your destination and save money from not paying for gas.

We all know that gas prices are high and out of our budget. They've reached four dollars, that's insane! Why would anyone want to spend that money if they don't have to. There is a simple solution on saving your money that you waste on gas, and that is walking or riding your bike. Some people can afford the prices of gas but others are struggling in the economy but are to lazy to walk, nobody wants to get exercise so they drive everywhere.

Banning cars on the street is a good way to help people get exercise. If they know they can't drive, they would obviously walk or take a bike because they have places to be. It would be an effective way to get people to stop being lazy and helping their health. Some people would probably get frustrated because they have to walk everywhere but it's only helping them.

Walking or riding a bike is a good opportunity to realize the beauty of life without stressing out over bad drivers or traffic, saving money, and getting exercise. Most people would think banning cars on the street is a good idea for those few reasons. I know that it is super effective although some people may not see it until it actually changes.",0
"Did you know not haveing a car can make you happier. In Vauban,Gremany it costs 40,000 dollars for your home and garage. Because of this 70 percent of the population does not own a car and 57 precent of that sold there car to live there. Many of there residents say there much happier without a car. One offical named Heidrun Walter explained how ""When i had my car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" and its true driving makes you stressed.

Not only not have a car makes you happy but it also can save the ecosystem. Green house gas is a big problem in the world now. Carbon dioxide slowly filling are planet. Acts like Vauban, and others like it, can influnce the world to change from the dangeruos road that we desided to take. But Europe produces 12 precent of green house gas, America on the other hand produces 50 precent of green house gas. America needs to change or we all die off.

Paris has more smog then any other European capitals. Come on if you don't think thats terrable then you need a new mind set because this is evolving into a problem. They say that diesel fual is to blame. because 67 precent of Paris has diesel fuel. I think its because theres, I dont know, A billion people driving at the same time.

This concludes that we need to stop using automobiles. Because its killing are eco system and we can do it . Many small cities are doing it and there happy. So why do we have to be mad and lazy when we can be happy and active.",0
"I am all for Thomas Huang new invation. I think that the FACS is a grate invation we finaly have a way to see how people are feeling just by this computer. How this device works is that the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, then studys all 44 major muscles. Moving one or more mucsles is called an action unit. After that Dr. Huang relies on Dr. Pual Eckman, the creator of FACS to find out how the preson is feeling.

The FACS software can track facial movements even if your not smiling as broadly. Just when you think that is all it can do it can also identify mixed emotions each exspession is compared to a nertarl face showing on emotion. We humans can also do this, but we would have trouble describing each facial trait. Dr. Huang wants to do a test on Mona Lsa to see if she is really smiling or not. There going to use the software to see if it can tell use if she is or not.

as you can see this software is a grate tool i can see this devise helping use out a lot in the futer. If you are interested in doing this then go look at your self and then ask your partner if he or she knows what your feeling right now. I fell like we should have more people like Dr. Huang, and Dr Paul Eckman cuase the world is changing and we need to try to keep up and not fall be hind. Life is a intresting thing and what you do with it is all up to you.",0
"For many years, the automobile has become and remained a staple in the world as humanity's most popular choice of transportation. The number of cars manufactured by car companies has reached the hundreds of millions. Cars have been a trademark of American ingenuity and the evolution of technology. However, as we go into the great beyond that is the future, we must take into consideration the pains and risks of these vehicles, and if they are worth driving as the world population exceeds seven billion.

Few people can recall a time where global warming wasn't the main conflict of scientists today. The Earth gets warmer as pollution levels rise as smog around cities like Paris and Mexico City reaches an all time high. The polar caps are melting at a rapid rate as hurricanes ravage the mainland harder and harder each year. What caused this stuff to happen? Why, look no further than our friends, the factories and automobiles! These two have been quoted time and time again as the catalyst of the global warming crisis. With such an adverse effect on the ozone layer, governments around the world have to do something to stop it from rising any further, with nothing short of success. Places like France have realized the extreme rise in smog levels in the city of Paris, that they had to do something. So, they made a ban on driving for people with even numbered license plates with only a few exceptions, and banned odd numbered licensed cars the next to try to curtail this occurance. After a few days, it worked. The smog cleared just enough for the French government to rescind its ban on license plates for the city. Such a huge difference in smog in only two days means that making a ban similar to this could be nothing short of beneficial for communities around the globe. So why don't more communities take up the hard task of making this ban a regular happening? It's a slow process, but it is happening, in unlikely places. Including over in our Western European ally Germany.

Vauban, Germany is a small community town located near the border of France and Switzerland. This town is best known for it's extremely unorthodox method of removing greenhouse gases from the ozone layer. People have decided to give up their cars, just relying on other transportation like walking and taking a local tram. Street parking, driveways and home garages are just not allowed in the district, and this has caused a huge difference between non-car owners and car owners alike. Seventy percent of the population in Vauban does not own a motor vehicle, a large portion of them sold their cars to move out to this small, cozy little town. Busy sidewalks and the chatter of civilians outshines the faint murmurs of the few odd automobiles in the city. What started out as an odd social experiment has turned into a great community full of happy people. Although this type of community is generally unpopular, other countries around the world have come to like the idea Vauban came up with. The capital city of Colobia, Bogota, has a neat program they like to call the Day Without Cars. The title speaks for itself. Civilians would take one day out of the year to generally not use cars, to promote the likening of taking other modes of transportation to wherever you need to go. Countries in South America have noticed this day, and are looking to replicate it themselves, which ultimately signifies the success of the Day Without Cars.

Countries around the world have all tried to curtail greenhouse gas emissions, whether by making a community built around the non-use of cars, making a day celebrating the use of other modes of transportation, or just banning the driving of automobiles outright. As just of a cause it may be, Americans are still hesitant to enact such henious laws. However, if more communities are built around this clean idea, more and more people will flock to it. It just takes preserverence, a strong plan, and a whole lot of sidewalks.",0
"Should drivers be allowed to use their cell phone while driving you may ask? I believe not. In this essay, I will be explaining why drivers should NOT use their devices while operating a vehicle.

Using a cellular device while driving is a dangerous hazard. An expanding number of studies demonstrate that driving while at the same time chatting on a cellphone can be very distracting. However, most states have not banished handheld telephones, and none have prohibited all drivers from utilizing without hand gadgets.

Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research mobile phones are driving components that reason mishaps. Studies demonstrate that a mobile phone put drivers at a four-time more serious danger of an accident. Regardless of risk, individuals still use mobile phones since they need to be constantly accessible and stay in contact with other individuals.

People state that hands-free set is security since individuals can drive utilizing two hands. I any case, without hands gadgets don't wipe out the danger of causing an accident and even make it worse by recommending that the conduct is protected. Inquires about demonstrate that utilizing a headset can be as hazardous as holding a telephone while driving while driving that the discussions can take away attention from the drivers from concentration on the road and other drivers.

In conclusion, if individuals don't give up the cellular devices the number of innocent people dying on the streets will increase. It is the individual's duty to not bring about their own and other individuals lives. We need to stop these reckless accidents over something that is so simple to do. Put your phones away until you reach a certain location.",0
"In paragraph 4 it says ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with Oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.

The author also states that, Today, Venus still has some features hat are analogous to these on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, maountains, and craters. They recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, but a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. In paragraph 5 it informs us that NASA says, that the visit would not have easy conditions, but survuvable for humans.

In paragraph 1 the author tells us that, Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star,"" si one of the brightest points of light in the sky, easy even for an amateur stargazer to spot. Although, this nickname is misleading since Venus is actually a planet. The author also claims that Venus is the second planet from our sun. It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Also referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, occasionally the closest in distance too. The author also says ""Earth, Venus, Mars, our other plaetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus."" He also states that Venus is sometimes right arounf the corner, in space terms.

In paragraph 2 the author claims ""Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challening planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" He also states that NASA has sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud- draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spacecraft has touched down on Venus more than three decades ago."" But NASA is still studying how they could get a better way to study Venus.",0
"Wouldn't it be remarkable if in the future, computers could read you facial expression and tell exactly how you feel? In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" We now know it's possible, and thanks to the latest innovation in the technology world to Proffesor Thomas Hauang it could be sooner than we think. This new software, known as the Facial Action Coding System, is able to read your emotional expressions which is shown to be very promising to the educational system. Reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is vauble becasue it could regonize if a student is bored or confused, it could also modify the lesson in order for the student to learn better.

First, this technology could be used to tell if student are confused, bored, happy etc. Shown in the article in the 6th paragraph the author states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huand predicts."" And prefaces by stating, ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be diffrent."" If applied in the educational sence this could mean that the computer could see the students is confused and be able to spend more time trying to help that student comprehend the material. The computer could also modify the lesson.

Additionally, If that doesn't work then it could always modify the lesson in a way the student could get a better meaning of it. In the article the author states, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The computer is able modify the lesson so the student. maybe even the whole class, could be sable to get a better under standing of the subject at hand. Also the author states, ""Most human communication is nonverbal""

Using this sort of software in schools would do wonders not only for the edicational system but bussniess, the entertanment industry, and even the medical industry. It's fantastic to live in one of the most innovative and technologicly advanced periods of our time and because of things like this, the future only seems brighter.",0
"This artical,""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" is the authors way to give ideas on how to help get closer to Venus. the author starts out with how and what Venus looks like. The author also compares Venus to Earth and says ""[It's] Often reffered to as Earth's ""twin.""'

The author's article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" has a very good look into why we need to explore and learn more about Venus. The athor even gives ideas/ways for NASA to be able to explore Venus. Examples like ""...NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" This is one of the few ideas that the author gives out.

The whole artical is about how Venus is so like Earth or ""Earth's ""twin.""' This is a good artical to look for if looking up ideas for a essay because it gives facts like ""...Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size.""

Or facts about the devices that they used in the pass that didn't work like ""...simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface...""

To end off on a good term, the author had put in time to let people know that we should think smarter not harder to be able to see closer into what Venus is hiding. The Author says ""...Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doughts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" This meaning not to thing to hard and work with what you got insted of thinking of a way to get all information right away.",0
"Cars have been around for awile now and they seem to have developed into our everyday lifestykes. But for some countries there is no such thing. Having limited car usage can be great in some cases. It could really help the envirorment effectiviely, Provide less funds for people, and even challenge companies to pursue a bigger idea than just cars.

Our ecosystem is in dangered. All of the pollutio and waste that people put into the air needs to stop. The idea of having imited use of cars can provide a healthy and great looking earth. In the article by Robert Duffer ''Paris bans driving due to smog'' we see the understanding that paris can help support the idea for having limited usage of cars. ''After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city'' a sentence stated in the article. Paris typically has more smog than other european captials. ''Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (pm) per cubic meter comparied with 114 in brussles and 79.7 in london''. With nobody driving their cars for a day, they managed to clear up alot of smog and make the earth look healty again.

Having the idea for limiting car usage can also have a very big impacted on people financal funds. its common sense. Not having to pay for gas, car insurance, car payments, and even mechanical payments as well. And having not having to pay so much of those bills can provide person with a greater amount of cash in their pocket. But there can be a down side to not having a car also. Cars are made to get a person from one place to another and if there isnt any transportation how are you supposed to go to work or make some food stops. The solution is simple. Ride the bus, Walk, Bike, get some exercise for once, thats the biggest reason why america is  so lazy.

Car compaines such as Ford, Dodge, Toyota all compete with one another. But as the days go on by. Studies state that less and less people are buying cars. In the article ''The end of the car culture'' by Elisabeth Rosenthal states that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes on by. This has left researches pondering a fundamental question: Has america passes peak driving? My answer would simply be, No america has not passed peak driving, but how can you by a car and pay a buncg of bills with no money? Thats my question. People dream of cars everyday. Wishing they could drive a brand new converible Ferrari to school. But welcome to reality, were that really doesnt happen. And are economy does not help it one bit. ''at the Mobile Congress last uerar in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford motor company, Laid out a business paln. Discussing things like trying to collab with the telecommunications industry''. This could be and opening for are future. It could save times around a city and ensure that its also safe at the same time.

In conclusion the advantages of limiting car usage can provide the earth, the earth, the people, and Finance to be nice, beautiful, and simple. But nothing can happen if we ont act now.",0
"What is that thing on Mars?

Well, some people believe that it was something made by aliens. I am here to prove that it was not.

The thing on Mars first was photographed in 1976. It is a huge rock formation that resembles a human face. There are shadows that give it the illusion that it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Some believe that it is real evidence that there is life on Mars, well it is not. On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over the ""Face."" The new cameras snapped a photograph that was ten times sharper than the original one. The new image revealed that it was a natural landform. Some skeptics said that maybe the alien markings were hidden by the clouds, but in 2001 a newer image was taken. This image was captured on a cloudless day, so there was nothing obstructing the view. This image also shows that the presumed face was a landform, and not the ancient work of aliens.

So, in conclusion, the famous face on Mars was a natural landform. This is supported by the pictures taken in 1998 and 2001. The image captured in 2001 could also possibly see other objects if there were any. So, the face not a sign of life on Mars.",0
