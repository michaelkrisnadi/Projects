The temperature on the Venus is approximately 800 degrees Fahrenhite, and also has the atmospheric pressure 90 time greater than on Earth, this circumstances make the Human life quite impposible on Venus.

Well, we are no longer away from the time when we will visit different planets for our vacation trips. Although our neighboring planets are inhospitable of human life, however ; Astronomers are fascinated about Venus because it may once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago Vinus was covered with oceans and could have supported various froms of life. Even today, Venus have some features that are analogous to those on the Earth. Human's have sent plethora number of spacecrafts to Venus but didn't get success. NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to the study Venus. NASA's possible solution to hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray, as the temperature would be around 170 degrees Farhrenheit above that land, it will make easier for humans to research on Venus. To get samples of rock or gas, scientists has to conduct a mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and persional despite the risks. NASA has discovered that electronic devices made of silicon carbide can last for three weeks on Venus as they will not melt easily. NASA and many other organizations are working hard to make it possible for human to visit other planets.\n",

      "I have never liked Government intervention on desicions that should be left up to the people who feel the effect of mandate. However, Government intervention on limiting the amount of car usage may prove to be a genuinely good cause. It may prove to accomplish what Government was first formed to do; help shape the world to make it a better place to co-exist, not only with each other, but with the whole Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "At fist, it may seem a little crazy in our day and age to actually reverse the climb of our use of technology and innovation, like vehicles. After all, isn't that what we're supposed to do? Isn't it natural to constantly evolve as time passes? Well, cars aren't natural, and they destroy what is.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are facing dangerous pollution; \"After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city\" (Source 2, 10). This is alarming to me and many people who care for the Earth. Every day, we're facing new headlines of negativity, and although whether Kim Kardashian's dress fits or not is upsetting, I think we need to focus on more important things and expell the negativity we're always bashed with. We could be developing things that will really make an impact, like new breakthrough sciences on space, medical sciences, and so much more. Instead, \"All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change\" (Source 1, 7).\n",
      "\n",
      "But, there is hope in all this. Already, we're seeing improvements. \"The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company\" (Source 4, 32). Maybe reversing the climb of our use of cars isn't so hard after all; we can hit the ground running.\n",
      "\n",
      "A reduction in the ownership of cars has also shown a surprising improvement of psychological well-being. In Vauban, Germany, they have almost completely cut out automobile use in their community. \"'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor\" (Source 1, 3). It sounds like people can be much happier without the constant buzz of cars coming and going. The mention of children also makes me think that it would be a much safer environment to raise children without the stress of parents having to worry if their children would be safe with so many cars about. I think everyone remembers their parents telling them time and time again to look both ways before crossing, and then double check, and then hold their hand, and watch out for right-turning traffic. A reduction in automobile use, in this case, is directly related to the stress parents have over their children when doing something so simple as crossing the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, a reduction in automobile use and ownership gives the local Government something more beneficial to focus on, rather than spending millions on re-paving roads; \"Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up\" (Source 3, 28). With this change, local Government can focus on really improving the standard of living; more job openings with more buisinesses, easier travel (despite what one might think) during rush-hour, and a higher level of general safety with less danger of car accidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, I think it will be a hard transition to go through if Government does plan to get involved in the reduction of car usage. It's easy to make bad habits, but it's hard to break them. However, if we do succeed, we will see a huge improvement on the environment and the standard of living, and it will be really worth it. These are not views or opinions; these are facts.\n",

Many people feel that this is destroying our atmosphere and that we should cut down on imitions by walking, biking or car pooling. Efforts to cut down keep our atmosphere clean and breathable. Some communities such as Vauban, Germany have illiminated car use entirely.\n",

      "Vauban is a new experimental suburb where there is no street parking or driveways and the only place to park is in a garage where you must buy a space for 40,000 which has cut the car ownership rate down to only about 30%. There are as many as 5,500 residents in Vauban and most of them say they like it much better without having to worry about a car. In many suburbs however the houses are much to far apart for them to be car-free, though many areas are considering developments like this one so they can clean up the air.\n",

On one day odd numbered plates won't be allowed to drive and on the next day even, volaters are fined $31. As many as 4,000 drivers are fined. Only once the smog was sufficently cleared did they allow both plate types to drive. Limiting driving can prevent problems like this from occuring in all cities.\n",

      "\n",
      "Using cell phones while driving has a big impact on car wrecks, I believe that cell phone usage while operating a motor vehicle should be prohibited because they play a big part in distracting the driver.\n",
      "\n",
      "One reason cell phone usage should be prohibited is because when one is looking in their cell phone they usually look down and look back up but anything could happen in a split second leading to an immediate reaction without thought. According to studies and statistics \"Almost 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving\". Meaning out of all of the accidents that happen yearly 390,000 are due to texting and driving which could easily be prevented, just wait to send that text.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason cell phone usage should be prohibited is because it takes up time, the time you're using to send that one text or make that one call could be time used to get where you're going. The use of a cell phone while driving is inconsiderate of other drivers, it takes up their time as well. When people use their cell phones they only think of themselves, imagine if the driver behind you were in danger and you're using your phone wasting time at the green light. Most people don't put themselves in other people's places, yet things that you do can have an effect on another's personal life. If this was you in danger would you want someone driving slow in front of you because of their cell phones that they could check when they arrive to where they are going?.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, cell phones could cause anybody to do reckless driving. You could be on any social media and try to see what's going on in everybody else life instead of your own. Social media could wait on you until you get home. Cell phones cause reckless driving which cause accidents that could be prevented only if you waited those seconds. You never know what someone might say about you on social media, and you could get caught up in the drama. Driving while mad isn't a good mix. You could take your anger out while driving extremely fast then boom you crash.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, you're not paying attention to your driving, and road signs. Besides the green light there are more road signs. Like what if you were on your phone and you don't see the sign that signals a deaf child is alert. Then a deaf child was crossing the street, and you crash into them. This could be murder, and soon you'll be there locked up rotting in jail. Somethings are meant to be considered before you pick up your phone and text while driving. Most accidents could be avoided if you wouldn't be so careless about others. In a passage it stated \"Cell phones aren't the reason why there are car accidents.\" This isn't accurate because based on my research at least 88% of people die from car accidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion cell phones should be prohibited while driving. Most accidents can be caused by using a cell phone while driving. Think about a consequence that could come with your actions while using your cell phone, neither the less it can wait. There could be an occurring accident that could be prevented all if you would be careful and mindful of people. You should consider putting your phone on airplane mode while driving. It will make driving more easier and safer for you and the people you are surrounded by.\n",

      "Since World War II, driving has been the center of everyone's mind. Do you really think driving is a necessity? Many people will say yes, but most will argue no. Limiting car usage will be great for us citizens and our very own planet Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "To start off, driving causes you a stressful day, but not driving will save you time and money. Gas prices are more than 2 a gallon. One car takes more or less 10 gallons. Filling your tank up will cost you around 60 or more. In my eyes, it's cheaper to take public transportation than to drive. While taking the bus or the train , all you really have to do is wait , pay to get in, find your stop, if your destination is a little farther, there can be another bus and you'll be at your stop. On the other hand, Driving, your worrying more. Your worried about if you have gas, is there a traffic jam, why is this driver driving so slow. You're getting frustrated rather than taking the public transportation. In Colombia there is this program where you dont drive for a day. \"In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams\"Source 3. Not only did it cause a less stressful day, it allowed them to get some exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, I have a question. How many people like smoggy days? No one. Reason I asked this specific question is mainly because if you enjoy driving, you must enjoy the smog. \"After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city\"Source 2. Although Paris has more smog than other European capitals, it isnt good for our very own health, but it isnt good for our planet either. When Paris did this \"No Driving\" campigan, \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after 5 days of intensifying smog\"Source 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, driving isn't really important as it used to be. We have all these technological advances, that honestly make driving not necessary. We all have a cell phone, we can all video chat. Some work together, some go to school together. We all can carpool. There was this quote that I read, and after doing some thinking, it made me realize that driving isn't really important as it seemed to be. \"How much you drive is as important as whether you have an hybrid\"Source 1. Hybrids save alot of wrong doings that we already do to this Earth. Along with eletronic cars. Driving a hybrid, yes it's saving the world but your still causing traffic, and wasting money. Some people have already quit driving. \"With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit.\" Source 4. America has went so far into the stopping of driving that on highways there's more tolls. Tolls that we can't pay to another person, tolls where they take a picture of your license, find out you information, and send you the amount you owe through the mail. Each toll is different some can be 75 cents or a 1.50. From your home to the mall, depending where you live, you'll pass by more a less 5 tolls. In total thats around I'll say 3.75 or 7.50. Public transportation saves you more money. Mall's have buses where it picks you up from a specfic location to the mall and back. That's saving you time and your money.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, limiting car usage can be an advantage to both young, old and even to our very own planet Earth. It can help our economy, save our pollution rate, but also help us lose the weight.\n",

      "In a big city or a rual area all you see are cars flying past you at high speeds and releasing their gas fumes into the atmosphere. Having no cars is a great solution to having no traffic and less polution. Without cars our air would be fresh and it wouldnt take as long to get from place to place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although many people have cars and drive them regularly it is not always the best choice. Having no cars would be a drastic change to society but it would also be a major change in the way we travel and breathe in air. In Vauban, Germany the residents have gave up on cars. The streets are car free. \"As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there\". This piece from the text tells us that hardly any one is driving a car their. One of the residents says \"When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way\" this lets us no that without a car the resident is much happier and is not tense. Car release greenhouse gas emissions from there tailpipes. In the article \"In German suburb, life goes on without cars\" it says that \"passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States\". That is insane to think that much is released, but its happening daily from everyday car users. The environmental agency is trying to promote car reduced communities. Polution got so bad in Paris that they had to enforce a partial driving ban. After enforcing this the texts says \" congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog\". So limiting their drving in Paris reduced the smog. It is not always the best choiceto drive all the time exspecially if you job or social event your going to isn't far. In \"The end of car culture\" it says \" organize your summer jobs and social life around where you can walk or take public  transportation or car-pool\". By doin those things it will reduced smog and gases getting into the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "By not having any cars it would reduce polution, give us safer air to breathe, and it would be easier to get from place to place with any traffic. Cars release tons of gases and polute the air. WIthout cars it would reduce that problem. With less cars on the road and mostly public transportation it would be easy to get around instead of getting caught up in traffic. So not having cars wouldn't be such a bad thing after all.\n",

Others say that it's a humane way to end on going suffering. My HUMAN thesis is the debate over whether euthanasia should be legalized in the united states is politically fueled, the second the issue is put on a ballot the passionate anti euthanasia advocates will gather support making it almost impossible to pass all four of the necessary hurdles, and that the people of america are significantly divided over this issue it does not strictly follow party or religious lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "My first HUMAN argument states that the debate over whether euthanasia should be legalized in this country is politically fueled. Looking at the lines of support for both the pro euthanasia and anti euthanasia movements it is clear that party lines are not the only influential factor at play. Both line one (Republicans strongly oppose) and line three (Democrats strongly support) follow fairly consistent lines however line 2 (Republicans tend to agree with) and line four (Democrats tend to agree with) stray away from what would be expected. In order to completely answer the question of why euthanasia has the support that it does we must also look at religious influences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the issue of euthanasia is put on a ballot it becomes very difficult to pass all four of the necessary hurdules in FINAL. Firstly, the pro euthanasia movement must be able to gather the necessary amount of signatures in order to be put on a ballot. The constitutions of Calofornia, Michigan, Oregon, massachusetts, and Washington all require the initiative process in order for a pro euthanasia measure to have a chance. The signiture gathering stage drags the already difficult process of passing these laws out over an extended amount of time. Euthanasia advocates of the right to advocate to die also missed there 1996 deadline for colleccting signatures; the measure is now on the back burner. Next, lets assume that the proponents to make it past this stage to actually get the measure to a vote in the first place.\n",

      "The paeansvill oregon campaign in 92 did make it to the ballot where it was the first pro euthanasia measure to by put to a popular vote in the U.S. Voters in paeansill rejected the proposed law by a margin of 54 percent to 46 percent, and perderson lossed his effort to expand oregons law the following year. The NO to 119 campain also gathered of the necessary signatures to get in on the ballot, but in october the organization that was filed with running the campaige folded because it did not of enoough money to continue. Finally, lets examine the oregon statute. In order to pass an initiative in oregon there must be affirmative support from a majorit of voters, and the margin of victory must be no less than 2 percent of the total votes case at the election. In the 1994 clack sky of oregon case the supporters of the death with dignity act suffers defeat when initial results for a 7,939-vote margin began to shrink to about 5,000 votes.

      "\"The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.\" Drivers shouldn't be able to use their phones while driving because it creates a distraction that could not only lead to injury to the person on their phone but also other innocent drivers on the road. Even the most experienced drivers can find themselves losing control of the wheel while concentrating on their phones. Also driving is a task that requires constant awareness, any type of diversion can lead to accidents no matter how quick it is. In a lot of cases death and serious injury is the result of \"glancing\" at your phone even for two seconds. In reality no text, call, video, etc is worth losing a life over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally the mortality rate behind using cellphones while driving has caused some states to take legal action. 19 states have banned hand-held cell phone usage while diving, 39 states bans any cell phone usage for novice drivers, 20 states bans any cell phone usage for school buses and 48 states have banned texting while driving. So not only is cell phone usage while driving dangerous but also illegal. So if you are using a cellphone you risk getting into an accident and getting into trouble with the law, which could possibly require jail time or a fine. Also this can affect your insurance, constant tickets and fines from texting while driving can make your insurance go up almost two times its original cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause car accidents. Studies show that using a cell phone can make you 4x more likely to crash. Despite the dangers, people still use their cell phones while driving to communicate or occupy themselves. Some may argue that using hands-free features is safe, but research shows it can be just as dangerous as holding the phone because the conversation can distract drivers from the road. Distracted drivers have a slower reaction time meaning in case of an emergency where they need to make a quick move they won't be able to. Having that quick extinct when you're not distracted could make the difference between life and death.\n",

      "Although people may say \"It was just a one time thing, I barely text while driving.\" Science begs a differ, during recent years it has been studied that texting while driving has become a huge epidemic. Scientist have even compared it to craving junk food, stating that like junk food we crave being on our phones. Study shows that the average person check their phone once every 12 minutes and 80 times a day. So using your phone while driving can definitely become a habit even if you just do it a \"couple times\".\n",

Putting up your cell phone and waiting until you're at a stable place can save your life. No one should put themselves or others at risk to reply to a text message.

It is not clear whether Christina saw that sweet message before her car slammed into the back of a truck while merging onto the highway. From the lack of response, David became worried. He attempted to call Christina and left several messages requesting to hear her beautiful voice. But to no avail he could not reach her. David knew something horrible had happened. Christina, a beautiful twenty-year-old was dead. Police ultimately deemed texting the cause of her fatal car crash.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the police found evidence that texting and driving caused her untimely death; the likelihood of a car crash increases drastically with the occurrence of distracted driving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Distracted driving occurs anytime a driver takes their eyes off the road, hands off the wheel or sometimes just simply being a teen carrying too many passengers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Distracted driving is a huge problem, although it is not due to cell phones alone, they are a huge contributor. Taking your eyes off the road, even for a second, can be risky. Because operating a cellphone takes the drivers attention off the road, long enough for them to veer into other lanes of on-coming traffic. Because of this, it only takes a split second for this type of distracted driving to become a fatality. For this reason, it is necessary for drivers to focus on driving only and leave their cellphones in their pockets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, text messaging requires you to visually and manually use sometimes both of your hands; it is by far the most frightening distraction used by not just teens, but adults as well. Most vehicles are considered a weapon. Consequently, they can cause extreme damages during a crash. This is why it is never safe to take your hands off the wheel, even to answer a call. As a result of this, some states have chosen to pass laws prohibiting motorist form using their cellular devices while operating a motor vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, most of us realize that social media rules the land. In this day in age, if it's not recorded it didn't happen. Seeing that teen drivers lack experience while driving. Consequently, means that they require more focus than experienced drivers. Therefore, carrying too many passengers while trying to operate a cellphone is hazardous to all parties involved, including innocent bystanders. Studies have shown that too many passengers can be a huge distraction, especially while using a cell phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, texting and any type of distracted driving seems to be a social issue and will possibly take individuals awhile to change or completely stop. Hopefully people will understand sooner than later, that multitasking while driving is dangerous for all.\n",

Making your feet be your gas instead of a pump when the distance is close enough, and even biking occasionally.

      "Cars release a great amount of polluants into the air increasing smog in some areas worse than others, like in Paris, China, and other places. Providing or opening your mind to other ways to get from one destination to the next, would reduce the smog thats in the air. This simple action as close to 70% of the population pitching in can result in a healthier environment, and some people may agree with Heidurn Walter. She says \"When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way.\" Not only that, people who do not agree or get rid of their transportion vechicles will be fined. For example, in Germany you have to pay $40,000 if you want to get a car owner space and this does not include the money you have to spend on your house. Than, in Paris 4,000 drivers were fined $31 dollars after not leaving their cars home after a public annocement was made to do so. This shows that opening this can increase health, or make an environment cleanier. Plus, you actually inforcing something that is good for the environment will get people to participate, such as a fine.\n",

      "Hearing engines roar and cars zoom pace is a sound all too familar with citizens who walk or ride constantly. It can be quite on the thrilling side crossing the streets or even walking down a busy rode when you know being hit is a possibly. Limiting car usage can decrease the risks or heavy weighted vechicles hitting biking, or walking citizens that dont have a chance against the weight. This increases saftety, bumping into another human or being nugded by a bike wont affect your body as much as a 500 pound or even heavier car crashing into a 100 pound person. Like, Carlos Arturo said \"It's a good opportuinity to take away stress...\" meaning the stess that comes with a car. The money for gas and the risk or hitting someone or being hit is taken away when on foot or on bike. This shows limting car usage isnt only increasing the safety or people walking or biking, it also takes away stess factors like money, fixing a car if it needs repair, and other factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, having alternate forms of transportion can open your eyes to a whole need world. Instead of constanly beiong locked in your 4 door honda prison or your house you're outside seeing new people and increasing social interaction. Not only this, but you're getting excerise and maintaining your health or builing it. Which is another reason to limit the amount we use our cars. This shows that doing so can not only increase saftery, and money, but health and social oppurtunitys.\n",

      "real_data Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions (Rosenthal 34). Global warming is becoming more of an issue as time goes on,  part of this problem is vehicles and their pollution they let off. People are getting more and more worried about this as temperatures continue to rise on Earth. They are trying to do something about it. One of the more popular suggestions to help solve the issue is to limit car usage. I know, it seems pretty bizare due to the fact that some towns, such as my own, do not have everything citizens need within a walking distance. Benefically, \"stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway.(Rosenthal 6)\". It is thought that it will \"drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States (Rosenthal 5)\". People also are not putting forth an effort to help decrease the pollution by buying hybrids, instead they buy Diesels. Diesel gas has more pollutants then regular gasoline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Safety is another reason to reduce car usage. Think about it, if pedestrians reduced their car usage by 50 percent the percentage of car accidents would also decrease. This could save many people's lives; animals as well. Rosenthal said, \"Cities could become denser, and better for walking\", which also makes it safer. To go along with saving lives lets mention health. Americans are getting more and more unhealthy and overweight. It is a rising problem in our country. Many people die from it everyday; obesity can be stopped. One way to lose weight and get in shape is exercise. Imagine how much better shape Americans would be in if we actually had to walk to the grocery store or McDonald's. It would make us think \"do we really need that?\". Those extra burned calories count, sitting in a car does not burn many calories.\n",

      "Traffic jams are aggravating to most people, with the decreasing number of car owners time is being saved. There is less traffic. Andrew Selsky studied car-free day in Bogota, and he stated \"rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic(28)\", this means time is being saved and people are getting to their destinations faster. Another idea was said by Carlos Arturo Plaza \"it's a good opprotunity to take away stress...(Selsky 24)\". Congestion stresses everyone out, whether running on time, running late or just taking a leisurely drive. It makes everyone stress. Congestion actually decreased 60 percent in Paris (Duffer 14).

You may wonder what other ways are there for you transport to the places you need to go. You could walk, jog, hike, bike, skate, or take public transportation.

      "In these times, phones are a huge distraction while on the road of driving. A Georgia law was made that drivers are to have a phone holder while driving in the vehicle, but there is still a large abundance of deaths in due to car accidents. According to research conducted at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away their phone while driving outweigh any drawbacks. In my opinion, I believe that phones should not be allowed of use during driving because it is inconsiderate of other drivers, it is illegal, it increases the number of deaths per year, and because it's a myth of multitasking while driving.\n",
      "\n",
      "One reason I believe that phones should not be allowed of use during driving because it increases the number of deaths per year. For example, cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. Distracted driving is dangerous, and cell phone use while driving is a major factor. In 2018 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving was involved in 2,841 motor vehicle crash fatalities. Among those killed: 1,730 drivers, 605 passengers, 400 pedestrians and 77 bicyclists. Knowing cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help people manage a dangerous crash risk. Though texting and driving caused many injuries and deaths, there are still people who don't think it's a problem and are confident that they can use their phone and drive simultaneously. However, 34% of teens aged sixteen to seventeen spend about 10% of their driving time outside of their lane. This affects other people who are driving and can cause the deaths of innocent lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason I believe that phones should not be allowed of use during driving because it is inconsiderate of other drivers. The consciousness of events happening around vehicle has a huge impact on driving. It is necessary for the drivers to monitor outside events and their possible impacts on driving. Using cell phones make it difficult to keep an eye on the outside events. Negligent behavior is highly immoral and unethical as it exposes human lives to a huge threat of accidents that could ultimately lead even to death. Now, a new study indicates that damn near everybody uses their phone while behind the wheel, damn near all the time. Using sensor data from more than 3 million drivers and 5.6 billion miles of trips, driving analytics company Zendrive found drivers are using their phones on 88 percent of their journeys.

Multitasking is valued in today's culture, and our drive for increased productivity makes it tempting to use cell phones while behind the wheel. People often think they are effectively accomplishing two tasks at the same time. And yes, they may complete a phone conversation while they drive and arrive at their destination without incident, thus accomplishing two tasks during the same time frame.\n",

They even live in sand, coral reefs, seagrass, under rocks, and even in-between little grains of sand. These creatures feed off of stereo and bacteria or particles in sand. They can feed for about two hours, after that they just lie there motionless. They can even eat with bubbles. They take in water into the mouth, blocks off the water by using their tentacles, squirt the water out, then eat the particles with a mouth. No matter there has been different types of eating each species has a different type of plan of attack. Some sea cucumbers eat floating particles, while other eat whatever stays on the sea floor. Some even swim in order to find food. There are even a few that swim all of their adult lives. They are even a few that live a little longer then other. Some living up to 30 years.

The author also tells us how this idea came to life and how scientists began to figure out how it works. This author then gives a few example of how it can be used and why.

Although hurricanes devastate residents each year, there are advantages to living in the Bahamas, such as the breathtaking scenery, the friendly locals, the beautiful water, the government's response time to natural disasters, and how the government helps the residents after a natural disaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bahamas is known for being the most beautiful place on the earth, with beaches and breathtaking scenery. A day on the beach in the Bahamas is not like a day on the beach in America; it is more private and peaceful. Also, the color of the Bahamian water is the first feature that catches an American's attention because it is more blue. There is also a taste to the water, but it is not salty, it has more of a flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another advantage of living in the Bahamas is that the Bahamian citizens are very welcoming and friendly to the American residents. There is a number of people who moved to the Bahamas after receiving a warm welcome. Also, there is a type of ethnic mixture of people that adds a different flavor to the Bahamas. This ethnic mingling is very intriguing because there is always something to talk about and something to focus on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1st type of treasure in the Bahamas is in the beautiful scenery. The second is in Bahamian residents themselves. The 3rd and final thing that the Bahamian citizens use to their advantage is the Bahamian government. One American witness said that \"the difference between the U.S. and the Bahamas, though, is the people and the government. In the U.S., politicians always promise they will help, but they rarely act.\". People can learn from this statement because in the Bahamas a politician's word means everything, which means that a fake promise is equivalent to false hope. This also means that if the person cannot come through on a promise, then they should have never promised the thing in the first place; Bahamian politicians operate following this creed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the Bahamian government acts on promises, the rule is that no politician or person is ever perfect. These people do make mistakes, although that does not stop them. The Bahamian people brush off and keep going after a mistake has been made, that is just how they operate. They lose sight of the material things and the things that do not truly matter, and they focus on what is truly clear.\n",

      "generated data Smoking can cause many health issues, such as; lung cancer, heart disease and respiratory disease. Evidence suggests that teen smoking may increase the use of alcohol and other drugs, illicit drugs such as marijuana, and having multiple sexual partners. Smoking not only can cause the same health hazards for teens as for adults, but also can interfere with normal lung growth. I think that anyone younger than 18 should not be legally allowed to smoke because there are so many health risks, they can cause addiction as well as cause the brain to age faster. One-third of high school smokers will eventually die of lung cancer. Teens who start smoking at a younger age are at greater risk for both lung, oral and esophageal cancer. Kids who smoke have a significantly higher risk of apendictomy surgery, often a result of appendicitis then those who don't.\n",

      "Not only do the chemicals in smoke damage the natural health of a smoker teens smoking also can cause brain cells to break down at a faster rate.

The another study has found that the IQ of students who smoke decreased by 2.6 points, while those who refrained showed a normal increase in IQ points. These studies have been completedand reports have shown the the brain begins to age faster in teenage smokers since smoking affects mental functions. Smoking before age 17 increases the risk of cognitive impairment in middle age. Overall, there is sufficient evidence supporting the notion that teenagers should not be legally allowed to smoke. The severe health risks should deter anyone from smoking, but it seems especially important for teenagers to not get involved in the habit of smoking to live a long and healthy life.\n",

He states that, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\" Changing the reader's idea or previous image, that he already provided, passing from an \"inhospitable planet\" to a planet that \"was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life.\"\n",

In \"Summer Job,\" by Steve Lampman, the author reveals that when we are put under pressure or face the ups and downs of life, we find out who we really are. Lampman also shows that sometimes we may not like what we discover about ourselves, and we can grow to become someone we did not intend to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "In \"Summer Job,\" the author tells the story of a young boy who is going on his first job interview for a summer job. Already we learn that this boy has led a very sheltered life; his parents had always done things for him and had never allowed him to face any sort of danger. When the boy goes on the job interview and is put in a precarious situation, we see the first clue as to what he may be deep inside. In the story Lampman says, \"He stood there for a long time, unable to believe that this could be happening to him, unable to make a decision-he would have lived there all day just watching the submerged edge of the road and the little whirlpools made by the rain until the old man couldn't stand it anymore and thrust out his hand and pulled on the boys arm and said, Let's go.\" In this moment we see that not only has the boy never in his whole life faced a tough decision, he simply can't make one. This tells someone that this boy has very little character. We later see that the boy's lack of character will slowly disappear and that some good will come of the situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it seems that the boy will forever be a characterless young man, his true colors begin to come out. In another situation where the boy is put under great pressure, the author says, \"For the first time during the summer, the boy was furious, furious with himself, furious with everybody that was not even there.\" This outburst of character after being so indecisive for his whole life shows that the boy has grown to become someone different. He has made a decision that cost him his temper, and even through his anger, he is beginning to be seen in a different light. Although the boy has grown some from living through these situations, Lampman shows us that along with the good can come the bad.\n",

The National Safety Council today called on state and federal lawmakers to ban the use of cell phones and text-messaging devices while driving. Due to the number of accidents that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal.\n",

Due to the number of accidents that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal. Cell phone use contributes to 6% of crashes, and drivers are at a four times greater risk of a crash.\n",

But that can pose serious safety risks if someone decides to check his or her text messages, emails, phone calls, or any other mobile applications while driving. Cell phone distraction rates are alarmingly high. Worst of all, the usage of cell phones before car accidents happen is known to be underreported due to potential legal issues. Using a mobile phone while driving is reckless behavior, and every single crash that happens due to it can be prevented.\n",

      "The safest possible way to use a cell phone while driving would be to attach it to the radio system or another suitable hands free device via Bluetooth.

So there is no better decision than to simply postpone calls until you have arrived at your destination.\n",

In this case, the object is a fictional romance. The boy lives in a run-down, dilapidated part of town. The town has a sinister air to it and around it.

      "generated data The 1960s were a turbulent decade in America, marked by the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, and the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. It was during this time that the counterculture movement emerged, a cultural revolution characterized by the rejection of traditional social norms and values. The counterculture challenged the status quo and advocated for alternative ways of thinking, living, and relating to one another. This essay will discuss the causes and consequences of the counterculture movement in America.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, it is important to understand the causes of the counterculture movement. One of the main factors that contributed to its development was the growing disillusionment with the government and the \"establishment\" during the 1960s. The Vietnam War, in particular, was a source of great dissatisfaction and opposition among young Americans. Many felt that the government was lying to them about the progress and purpose of the war, and they became increasingly frustrated with the draft process. This led to mass protests and demonstrations against the war, as well as against the government in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another cause of the counterculture movement was a desire for greater personal freedom and self-expression. Young people were tired of societal expectations and constraints, and they wanted to live their lives in a way that felt authentic to them. The counterculture allowed for experimentation and exploration in all aspects of life, including political ideology, religious beliefs, and sexual orientation. The movement emphasized the importance of individualism and the rejection of conformity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to understanding the causes of the counterculture movement, it is also essential to examine its consequences. One of the most significant effects of the counterculture was its impact on social and cultural norms. The movement challenged traditional gender roles and provided a platform for the feminist movement to gain momentum. It also sparked conversations about racial equality and led to the establishment of organizations like the Black Panther Party. The counterculture also brought attention to environmental issues and played a crucial role in the development of the modern environmental movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the counterculture movement had a lasting impact on music, art, and popular culture. Genres like rock and roll and folk music became closely associated with the counterculture, and artists used their platforms to spread messages of peace, love, and social change. The counterculture also influenced fashion trends, literature, and film, and its effects can still be seen in contemporary society.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the counterculture movement of the 1960s was a period of significant cultural and social change in America. It was a direct response to the turbulent events of the time and a rejection of traditional social norms and values. The counterculture challenged the role of government in society, advocated for personal freedom and self-expression, and had far-reaching consequences on social, cultural, and musical norms.\n",

Also teachers can tell you how to coop with certain stresses bust by scaning you with a computer program. This can also help teachers find the student that caused trouble if they are not cooperating, because the program can tell if the subject is lying or not. This claim is supported by the following quote. \" To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clies are sometimes used to spot when a \"smiling\" polictician or celebrity isn't being truthful.\" The program can also help schools by seeing if a student is under a lot of pressure and needs help right away.\n",

Most of the time employed students are missing meals because did you them of money but they still have ot help out with bills. They can be feeding their siblings and even paying bills that shout be otay their parents resposibilty.High school students do not wanna feel bad though so they do not tell their friends. When you are a high school student you needs friends to make it by great and this cause them to keep it a secret.  The first cause of employed students missing meals is that their parents take money out of their check affecting the child. Writing checks for rent, watr, light, and gas would make the child miss a meal. The would not be at home in time to get the checkle cutting most of Tv to get after school meals. So the only way left for them to get a meal would be at school but by them being an emplyed student they dont pay for their meals because they do not qualify for free or reduced breakfast. Most employed students even have to take that burden of having to supply all of their other school supplies. It is illegal for students under the age of sixteex to work on any night in the middle of a school week.

Ages seventeen and eighteen do not have to have an employment certifcation unlessthey play football. Students that work at your favorite place,cinma or even your local fast food restaurant often do without meals.The child is missin a meal because they might have been working a late shift and the time that the take to get off is to late to get food at school.To fix that problem writting a check for lunch would be great but most of the students cannot afford to buy lunch each and everyday. To fix this problem they would have to eat breakfast at school , pack lunch, fin somehere to get supper and would probably not get a snack until they got back to their job.

The computers have no idea who you are but they still know what emotion you are feeling just by how the bones in your face are working together.\n",

      "The computer will form a 3-D model of the face. All of the 44 major muscles have to work exactly like the human muscles in the model. They have classified six basic emotions such as: happiness, surprise, disgust, anger, sadness, and fear. Most people like to hide their emotions with thier face so people don't know that something is wrong. The computer could see right through that and see exactly what emotion is going on.\n",

If we had those computers in the classrooms then the teachers could help us more by knowing the truth. The teachers could figure out a better way to teach the lesson so the kids are'nt so confused.\n",

Imagine using this for someone yu are teaching or explaining something to yoou would want them to learn whatever that is you're helping them with would'nt you? But if that person is scared or shy they wouldn't be so easy to tell you that they don't understand. If we used these computers properly and not just as some toy then we could change how education is taught and it not being so difficult to understand so you could recieve better education quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Teachers already try their best to help their students but sometimes it's just more difficult than it seems. Children like to give attitude when not understanding something or when they feel like the teacher is judging them because they don't understand something. When it comes to school and work it's alot of stress and focusing but if teachers had a better way to recognize the emotions of their students it'd be easier for them to help them out instead of leaving them there and not understand anything.\n",

A similar issue could have happened before, so studying the past will help us handle easy obstacles. We don't recycle events, but we may repeat the solution. For example, you can study how World War I started and ended, and that will give you a general idea of how World War III, if there is one, will start. Secondly, history gives you knowledge about the world. Sometimes, history is a requirement to graduate or pass a certain class. There are history textbooks because of the value of history. Lastly, history is very helpful when it comes to economics. Knowing the history of the stock market and budget plans are helpful to society.

      "real_data The Face on Mars was not made from an ancient alian civilization. We have proof of this because our cameras are ten times sharper than the cameras we had to orginally photograph the face, the shadows just create an illusion that the formation is a face, and the Face on Mars has been confirmed to just be a mesa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first photo we had of the Face on Mars was taken in 1976 by Viking 1, which would not have had the most advanced cameras. The photo is blurry and unclear, not a very reliable source to base alien belief on. Even the photo in 1998, \"snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginal Viking phtos.\" Compare the photo from 1976 to the photo taken in 2001. The 2001 photo clearly shows that the Face on Mars is in fact not a face at all. Any belief that the Face on Mars was created by aliens should now be wiped away because of how clearly the photo shows that the Face is just a landform.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the original photos were taken in 1976, there was the illusion that there was a face staring right back at the Viking 1. Shadows around the Face created this illusion that made it look like and Egyptian Pharaoh. When the 1976 photo was released for people to see, the caption read, \"huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\" Even the experts immediately recognized the Face on Mars as just a natural landform with shadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though some people believed the Face was an alien artifact, this theory is disproved quickly because in truth the Face on Mars is just a mesa. The Face on Mars is in the area of Mars known as Cydonia. Cydonia is known for having lots of Martian mesas. Martian mesas are very similar to mesas or buttes found in the American West. Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program Jim Garving quotes, \"It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\" Which is a lava dome the takes the form of an isolated mesa, and is approximately the same hight as the mesa known as the Face on Mars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though some theorists still believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, it turns out to be just a Martian equivalent of a mesa. This is proved true by the advanced camera quality, the proof that it was just shadows creating the illusion that the Face on Mars was actually a face, and the fact that the Face has been confirmed to just be a mesa.\n",

First, get a packet and use the scissors to cut it in a straight line across the center end of the packet. Next, use the scissors to cut a small rectangle shape on the top half of the packet you cut off. Then, take your lipstick tube and twist it all the way down, then place the bottom part of the tube into the packet you cut a rectangle on. Finally, twist the lipstick all the way up, fit the top half of the packet back on the bottom half, and enjoy your air conditioned lipstick tube.

They talk about key jobs such as, Farm Director (General Manager), Assistant Farm Director (Assistant General Manager), Player Development (Head Coach), Strength & Conditioning (Gym Teacher), and the Athletic Trainer (Nurse). The game of Ice Hockey is a unique sport that might go beyond playing games at the collegiate/professional level, but there is always a place for skilled hockey players in this world to remain employed. The Boston Bruins have multiple people who specialize in analytics to help develop the skills of their younger hockey players. One person who stands out the most in the Bruins analytics department is Kayla Frantzis, who is the manager of this department and creates structure for the Bruins to develop and progress. The every day process, which occurs with each player in the organization, is tracking the player through the organization and knowing exactly what the best thing is for that player such as, where is the best league for this player to currently play in, or even as simple as, weight, and height stats are recorded every six months. Technology is essential in the development of these players today because of the hard work and research that is done on each player, to help benefit them in the future to prepare them for the professional leagues of hockey. Technology is a beautiful thing when it comes to analytics for developing specific hockey players, but has it taken developing hockey players and studying the outcomes on the ice too far? There comes a time in everyone’s life where technology can be taken too far. Kayla Frantzis is a very skilled women at what she does, but some might say that recording everything down to the very last bite a player takes, can be too far and even invade a player’s privacy, is that true? Would taking technology completely away from the development process for hockey players slow their progression in this crazy world of always improving technology?\n",

Second of all the presidents only campaign in states they are not sure of and completly ignore the states they know they will win source 3 paragraph 19. This may be a good strategy but if we instead abolished the Electoral College then everyones vote would matter and the candidate would have to campaign in every state to ensure his victory.

The new advances in technology are making conversation much easier to have, and creating many new ways to learn about and get to know people.\n",

Now days all of that time has been cut out, and even with something said offensively if a sincere apology is made right after words can easily be forgiven. Another example of this is the creation of electricity which was a major leap in the technology department. Before electricity the main mode of communication was through the newspaper, which was a very impersonal way of sending messages. Reading about the death of a loved one in the newspaper, or reading about a celebration that someone was not able to attend would have been very hard.

Teenagers as well as adults use facebook to keep in contact with friends and family members that are far away, to learn new things about the people around them and to share thier life with others. This proves that although the advances in technology make a great new toy for people to play with thier main purpose is to provide people with a much more efficent way to coomunicate with others. The new advances in technology also allow people to get to know one another so much better.

Going to Hilton Head Island in South Carolina is a dream come true to anyone, and it was a dream come true to me that's for sure.\n",

It was my first day of summer, and I was ready to start this hot and the blazing vacation filled with the joy of my friends. I was excited to see what God was going to bring to me through this vacation and how He was going to teach me new things, make friends, and how He was going to work in the hearts of my friends. I didn't want this vacation to just be a vacation that I list down as one of my most fun summers, or trips that I went on but I wanted it to be a time when I grew closer to our king. I wanted the Lord to use my heart to be able to help my friends, and for us to be able to experience him in a new way by being so close of friends.\n",

The Lord really showed me that this is th way to be, and that loving people includes a lot more then juicing people with the love notes and letters. The sacrament of true love is in serving others over yourself, and that when you truly care for people as the lord tell you to so many things will fall into place. That your love life isn't you but it is Christ and berries love life is you as his child. They showed me this by never treating another the way he treated someone there, and by being his child in all that that means whether anyone would see it or not. They taught me some good love examples to look at and evaluate when thinking of my own life.\n",

      "generated data In the article \"Should We Use $700 Computers to Help Us Learn Math?\", a math teacher Mark Davidson is trying to explain to the school bored at his middle school that computers would really help the students out by having one themselves. Davidson gose and checks out the computer before he ask's the school bored. He uses the software by Stanford Mathematician Conrad Wolfram he wrote to teach his young daughter math. In the artice Davidson quotes \"I'm doing math constantly, but all I'm really doing is supplying a tool for math doing-and-learning that's personal.\" The reason why the teacher is all for the computers is because a child can go out and get a personal math tool like a calculator to use in class to do math, but you wouldn't take out your calculator to do a quick math problem on the go. The student can take out his computer to do the math problem quickly. The artice suggests that the students should get a computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that the students should be aloud to recieve a computer because like the artice says it gives you the feeling of an accomplishement for your own tool that would be your personal math tool. I agree with Davidson saying that as a math teacher this would not be a good ideal messase to tell your students about math. I was was reading this article and thinking how crazy it is that this is even a questioned asked, because of course as a student I would want a new laptop after reading that yes there are cons about the laptops, but i'm going to use technology someday when I have a probabley a child and I do no't want them to take the middle school exit exam just so they can have a laptop all because I can't trust my own child with a math equation. Think about how quick this world is evolving today by just technology. Lets say the student have a bestfriend who doesn't learn as quickly as you and has no computer who you allow to share a locker with to get his books between every class not only would that be a struggle because we student's have became so glued to looking at a screen ALL day. Cars are also evolving by speed limits sure the driving age is 16, but more then half of high school students might not even be driving to school because they can stay home doing homework until it's time for the bus to pick them up unless you live really close to the school. That's all the students will be on for the ride is to look out the window, but look how this world is evolving it might not be faults in like 3-4 decades nobody wants to go out and play aka do somthing besides stay home attached to a SCREEN little kids now only even know how to communicate by texting because of how much they love technology. So as a math teacher Mr. Davidson wants a laptop because it will supply his work, home, his own children and students with technology for math. Better yet laern how to operate surely there will be struggles the more you go on the more you'll adjust and limit your way of destracting yourself so I think that if the school command gets the laptops it should have a nice reward for not allowing students to be on them. That is my opinion in the questioned asked. Are Laptops Good Enought for Our Students?\n",

Even after our many launches of aircrafts into the atmosphere, we know very little of what it truly out in the endless void of space. In the article, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests that studying Venus specifically is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author would be correct in this statement as we humans know very little about the planet because of numerous factors making it a difficult planet to study, but solving those problems would lead into advancement. Including that becuase the planet is closely related to earth, that could mean it supported life long ago. Lastly that striving to meet the challenge presented, despite the roadblocks, would lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.\n",

      "The planet in space we call Venus has a reputation for how troubling it is to study because of numerous factors. As included in the article, Venus has \"A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets...clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid...planet's surface tempurature average of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit...Atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater...\" Venus is an extremely difficult planet to study which is why it would be such an amazing goal to study it fully. If NASA and the people of Earth fight to overpower these issues, we would advance as a species, developing more solutions to fight these problems. By facing the problems presented by Venus, we would finally be able to study it and even find out is there is, or was life on Venus.\n",

It was even stated in the article that Venus even has features extremely similar to some found on Earth, furthering the support that Venus could have or does support life. Regardless if Venus supports life or not, if we as a species can get past the barriers of Venus, would lead us into many equaly intimidating endeavors that we can surpass.\n",

      "The author sugests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and supports that when they say, \"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equaly intimidating endeavors.\" They also say in the next sentence \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\" By surpassing the challenge of Venus, we will have the technology an wisdom to surpass other difficult challenges we may encounter, overall gaining the knowledge and power to gain more knowledge and power.\n",

People are always stuck on their phones, that it seems they can never let it go while:working ,at school,cleaning,and driving. Some things caused by using your phone while driving are car accidents, irresponsible people driving, or you can get a fee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phones can be such a distraction to everyone at anytime including while driving which is a safety hazard. A major cause of deaths in the US is motor vehicle accidents because of phone usage most of the time. \"About 33,700 people die in motor vehicle each year\" shown on CDC. This means that some of the accidents are from phone usage and other factors, but if people stop using their phones while driving their could be less accidents in the future. In the article \"Mobile phones and driving safety\", it stated that,\"In a 2011 study it was reported that over 90% of college students surveyed texts (initiate,reply,or read) while driving.\" It proves that even adults can be immature that they use their phones while driving even when knowing the possible consequences they may have. If people continue to use phones while driving then the rate of death will get higher and people would think that nothing will happen to them while using their phones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many people may say that teens are the ones driving irresponsibly by using their phones when operating a vehicle. In reality, everyone from every age is irresponsibly driving. According to an article of \" Teen driver source\", \"In 2015, 42 percent of high school students who drove in the past 30 days reported sending a text or email while driving.\"The other half were most likely adults in which adults should set younger people an influence because they learn from them. In another passage on \"Science Daily' stated that, adults are always on their phone while driving with young kids either by sending a text, reading texts, on social media, or their just distracted driving. I believe that the adults should be more cautious including the teens but adults tend to have younger kids with them in the car.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both the adults and teens are guilty of driving on their phones, but they should learn sooner to avoid any type of tragedy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each state in the US has their own laws to protect their people. Since some don't listen the people in charge of the state they've made laws for people who drive careless. About 43 states have prohibited drivers to text or even be on their phones (Facts & Statistics about texting and driving). Even though not all states have been prohibited of being on their phones, almost all of them have which is a good difference. In some states if the police stops you for the first time for texting and driving, you can get a fee depending where you live. For example, Georgia has a fee of $150, Florida has one of $30,and New Jersey has one of $400. The fee law is a good option because if they stop you a second time then you could have jail time if you didn't learn the first time from the fee. If the US keeps making stricter laws of being on the phone while driving then the people will learn.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, driving while using your phone at any age isn't right. By one simple distraction something tragic could occur. It's not always teens driving reckless, but if anyone act young by not responsibly driving then they could get a fee they have to pay. Driving while using the phone should be taken more serious to prevent any issues.\n",

This pollution causes many close suburban areas with homes around to breathe in gas emission from cars. This is absolutely not healthy at all to many people. For example, in the article written by Robert Duffer in his title, \"Paris bans driving due to smog.\" States that, \"[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particular matter (PM) per cubic meter...\" That is more toxin to inhale that could possibly kill you!

Now, instead of using cars the people living in Germany are walking, riding bikes, or using trams to get from one place to another. So far, the people do not mind having any cars around and they even say they are happy and like the new change on where they live. \"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,\" says Heidrun Walter from the article by Elisabeth Rosenthal titled, \"Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.\" So whenever you first sit in a car think about what you are about to do and think about how you can benefit yourself and the world by not spreading pollution emission from cars.\n",

When we look at pictures we usually notice the obvious rather then the little detail. A human face has many features that can give away a persons emotions. You look at the obvious that is staring you right in the face and dont think about the fact of what if that isn't a correct interpretation. Lets take the picture of a landslide what would be your interpretation? I would see it as a beautfiful display of mother nature's fury, but I do not know that the house in the bottom is mine and that this is a very destructive image.

What would be your interpretation of this picture? Most people would see it as a beautiful nature shot of clouds and a mountian with a \"literal\"(which would be the visible meaning of the emotion in the picture) breathtaking sunset, but on the inside it was said to be a picture of our greatest achivement in engineering with one step out onto the glass. So if someone were to ask \"how cool is it to be on the over a 1000-foot-high glass bottomed walkway during the time of  demand when the sunset is particulary vibrant?\" You would probably say that it is pretty neat because there is a visible sunset, but in all actuality there is no rainbow in the sky at all it is instead not only a bland colorless face, but it is also raining.\n",

Your interpretation of the picture might stand back and you might start thining more about what could be going on because this character is very important and is crucial to the story and in order to do that you would need to know their feelings, but what if this character is a villain and thier main thing is not to show how they're feeling?\n",

An example of this concept would be if everyone on Earth died out, the next civilization to find the Sphinx would see it as a giant building of sadness due to the frown, even though we interpret it as a great piece of art. For thousands of years, emotional theories have been developed over descriptions of the most complicated thing on this planet: the human body.

Body language becomes a thing of the past and so do lies since this software becomes a regular household piece of electronic.

      "real_data Dear Mr. Senate, I believe that we should change the Electoral College to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I think we should change it because it's unfair to voters, you can't trust that the electors will vote for who you want to vote for, and then there is the disaster factor'.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, the Electoral College is unfair to voters. As Bradford Plumer pointed out in the article, The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,\"The electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states.\"So basically what he is saying is that if one state already has a lead and the candidate has no chance of winning he isn't going to focus on them. The candidate is only going to focus on the states where he has a chance of swinging the vote towards himhence the term swing states.For example during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second of all, you cant trust that the electors that you vote for are going to vote for the president you want. For example, what if you want to vote for Obama and so you vote for the elector that says he will vote for Obama, but then when its time to vote the elector changes his mind and she votes for rodney instead. Now what? You put your trust in one person and she didnt vote for who you wanted. Now you might have to wait another four years to have a chance of getting a different president.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last but not least, one of the single best arguments against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor'. In the article, The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,it states,\"Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.\" The oppsong claim states that we should keep the electoral college. Some reasons stated in the article, In Defense of the Electoral COllege: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,are,\"A dispute over the outcome of an ELectoral College vote is possibleit happened in 2000 but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The Electoral Colllege requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. The winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidatesas we saw in 2012's election to focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states. The elctoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. The electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.\n",

Although the vast majority of the human brain is devoted to sight, our least acute sense, the two poorest human senset sight and smell are actually related, operating on the same principle: the more receptors, or sniffers, the better. Smell is the archaic sense; over millenia, our ancestors' survival depended on sniffing out the enemy, prey, or wild berries that could be found in dense underbrush.

Authorities in New Zealand have enlisted a folding sniffer dog named Pesto to combat smuggling of avocados and other produce; he can detect fruit scent on people or in luggage that is not visibly contaminated. Burglars sometimes advise clients to have canine units check their houses before installing electronic security systems, in hopes that even if the dogs miss the scent of the humans, they will scare off robbers by their mere presence.

When I saw that Todd Neff wrote that the Volkswagen called it \"a smart car that stands apart from rivals - the first crisp packet car\" and \"could be smarter, not louder, lower, cooler, happier, whatever.\", this showed that the new phone was not for the looks of it, it was for the technology dumb people, or even people that care more about technology than look, to access how good the technology of the car was. So, I took two minutes to sit and stare at the whole short essay prompt again, and I thought it over. Even though it is true that the LiDAR sensor is the car of the future, was it build just because of that reason, did we not take another thing into consideration, like that it was \"just another feature for the automotive industry to add on to the future car?\", or did we take many good, or an obvious reason to purchase it, into consideration, and purchase it because you were impressed with the car?\n",

In one of the cities people enjoy the \"Car-free days\" it relieves stress in people and helps clean the air of their enviorment. There are many different ways that limiting car usage is an advantage to us. Less stress, cleaner air, and a better enviorment.\n",

      "Firstly, one of the resons why we should not use car is becuse it analysis a lot of problems when wasing it, like out us or space snd the most important things that not only we have when we uses the car but also when we use the bus, the car has anon advantage. For example, if on a car crash one of the passenger get a problme it is very hard to find the solution to cure him, and it is more dangrous to use the car because of air pollution, noise pollution and water pollution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, one of the reasons with that people are familiar is a lot by usin the car that we change our transportation, is very harms would days because they not longer saw ther friends becuse they did not how they was go to ther house but the population whit that is going down now using something that a lot of people does is very important. For example, in paris most of the people were usinhare cars but ther job is very stressed because of cars so the major of then decided to use car ten to take the stress off beacus now they can talk with thier childrens and they say that the love it and the buses hae Less delay when the used it theis why the major of them vote for th enew life using more the bu.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finaly, one very important reason to undersad why we should not have car is becuse by not using it we can have less stress and less problems such As traffic jam, aacrash and more. For example, That always was one of the probems that we have every day to many people because very stressed by traphic jam theh were very mean but when many people that have blog were see the first person to have the day on sunday of a lot of people less stressed by not having traffic jam the car-freeouthday so they were ver happy so they cant relax more. But other of the bennnefir so they can also think that does not using the car is not a bain but it is a god bennefit for us.\n",

      "real_data Many Americans today use cars to commute from one place to another, like work or going to school. However, in recent times, car usage has significantly decreased due to its beneficial effect on many communities. Based on the information given, there are many advantages of limiting car usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of many advantages of limiting the usage of cars is that it can help the community. With lower car usage, the community's environment can potientally become much better. According to Source 2, France's partial driving ban caused its congestion to go \"down 60 percent... after five-days of intensifying smog.\" This drastic change in France's car traffic prevented further pollution and smog, which hurts the community. Addtionally, limiting car usage can push more people into excercising more. In Bogota, Colombia, many Colombians \"hiked, biked, skated...\" during their car-free days (source 3). Also, many \"parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city\" (source 3). With an increase of excercise, the community's people will not only become healthier and fitter, but prevent any more damage to the community.\n",
      "\n",
      "Futhermore, lowering car uage will benefit the community's patrons by providing a cleaner lifestyle. With limiting their car usage, the people of the community will save more money. According to Source 1, although cars aren't recommended, a car-owner may \"buy a space, for $40,000, along with a home (source 1).\" Normally, a decent size house is approximately $100,000 to $ 150,000 with parking as well. To add onto this, gas prices can become very expensive, especially to those to drive a lot. All this money spent on a pollution causing car can be put towards a child's education, or the community's benefit. Plus, the stress of ensuring a car's wellbeing at all times is eliminated as well, decreasing the amount of stress in citizens. Addionally, people are more happy with limited usage of cars. People like Heidrun Walter have said \"I'm much happier this way (source 1),\" because they feel safer and can provide more to the community. Happier people in the community leads a much cleaner, stress-free lifestyle where its inhabitants are able to thrive more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The advantages of limiting car usage includes assisting the community and providing a cleaner lifestyle for its patrons. With a positive community, the future generation's lifes will be enhanced. The youth of a community with a great outlook on the world will provide futher citizens with another fantasic community with the potential to grow and change. However, without this, the community will not thrive nor grow.\n",

      "Source 4 talks about the End of Car Culture.  Studies have shown that as the years go on, driving is becoming less and less popular which is sad for many automobile industries worldwide.  In America, the partial cause of the decrease in car usage is the unemployment rate being so low, it's not like someone has to go to work.  Gas is becoming to expensive, why would people even want to have cars if they can barely afford them?  Riding a bicycle is beneficial for more money in your pocket and more healthiness for your body.\n",

Fact is car crashes injure or kill more than 1milion people each year. 5 People in Germany challened the Driving laws as part of a polocies class. Most of them liked not driving. Urban planners have already started to design areas of northern europe for more home and job accessibility to reduce driving.\n",

While most people appear to be aware of the dangers of using the cellphone while driving, they even continue to take this risk. What would it take to make people to quit utilizing their cell phones while operating their car?\n",
      "\n",
      "Cell phones have become a part of many people's daily lives, making it a struggle for them to sit the down long enough to drive and reach their destination. In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were calculated to have cellphones in hand while behind the wheel. Cellphone usage while traveling has become the number one cause for vehicle accidents over the last two decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the phone while driving increases not only the driver, but the people around them chances of getting into an accident. In addition to it lessens the driver's awareness of their surroundings while on the road, causing more car accidents. \"Auto deaths have risen for two straight years, marking the biggest increase in more than dive decades. While lower gas prices have encouraged more driving, distracted driving due to cellphones has been tapped as one of the major causes. That has prompted many states to begin cracking down on phone use while driving with laws outlawing the behavior.\" (Pressman, A..Apr.2017)\n",
      "\n",
      "An increasing amount of states, prohibit the usage of cell phones while behind the wheel, exposing those drivers who break the laws to fines and additional punishments. What many drivers don't realize is that, not only could they receive fines for using their phone, but they could also be served with serious lawsuits if they cause an accident.\n",
      "\n",
      "A large number of drivers do not believe that their driving performance is impacted by the usage of their cellphones. More than one half of drivers who speak on cell phones while driving feel as if their driving is no different from them being off the phone. This shows that many people are ignorant to the impact they have on their selves and others when they use their phones while driving. This also shows why it's so important to have such strict rules and laws. \"Road safety appears to improve in states with laws that regulate driver's phone use. The states with the lowest amount of phone use while driving- Vermont, Oregon, Hawaii, and Washington- have all banned the use of handheld devices behind the wheel.\"(Johnson, D.Apr.2018)\n",

      "To sum it up, the use of phones while driving has proven to be a huge safety hazard to drivers and those surrounding them. There should be laws in all states and even countries that ban the use of any device or distraction while driving in order to decrease the number of accidents on the road. It would also help people to practice using their phones less and become not so dependent on their phones.\n",

Additionally, every individual should be able choose their own oppinions and beliefs. Intellectual freedom allows for a more accepting and open minded society.\n",
      "\n",
      "People should be able to have their own thoughts without being critized. In the ad, the young girl is judged for the type of computer she uses although no statement about her says she is American. The statement that is just because she uses a different kind of computer she is american is a prime example of critisism. Beside the fact that the ad completely contradicts the picture, crossing out the United States of American and replacing it with the technology capital of South America justs shows how we are falling into a society that relies on technology. Also, no individual should be labeled because of the equipment they use.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, everyone should be able to choose their own thoughts and beliefs. In the \"Lividity of Demonstrators\" article, a reasoning as to why the Syrian revolution failed is given. The reason stated why the rebellion started in Syria is because the Middle East is \"a deeply religious and sectarian restricts who's Sunni majority has long stewed beneath the heavy hand of the Alawai elite. The Syrians were greatly affected by their laws and rules and finally rose up against them in the revolt. The Syrians were denied intellectual freedom. They were not even aloud to have certain beliefs, read a wide variety of literature, or have access to the world through the internet. The revolt could have been potentially avoided if the Sydney government was more accepting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, intellectual freedom is important because it leads to a more accepting and open minded society. When everyone has their own thoughts and beliefs, there is a wider variety of ideas that can be shared. This allows people to think differently and not be stuck in one way of thinking. In the ad, when the girl posts a picture of her new shirt, all of her \"friends\" say something negative. They all critize her for wearing anything besides what they consider to be socially acceptable. However, when the boy sees the picture of her he starts flirting with her by saying she has good \"stylefogell.\" Because the boy was comfortable enough to give her a compliment instead of critizing her, they live in a very open society. This allows people to find new oppinions and beliefs and it averts critisim.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, smog can be dangerous to people and car status. For example, if people are walking and their is a lot of smog in the air, that can be bad for your lungs to breathe the in smog. The artice states \"when people breathe in smog they can develop respiratory problems such as bronchitits or even asthma.\" So then if people keep on breathing in the smog, they will get sick and they will most likely have bad lungs. Secondly, pollution such as smog is bad for car status. On Carsdirect.com it says that one of the signs that your engine or cars status is bad is that, \"When you check your vehicle's oil, it's blackened and mucky from contamination of the oil from the combustion gases blowing by the piston rings.\" So you know not to have alot of smog and pollution where you are driving and where your car is because then the status of your car will become awful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, smog is not just bad for the environment and people, it's also bad for buildings. As stated in the artice pollution \"damages view of landmarks, contributes to climate change, and decreses air quality.\" If you are around pollution then it just only gets worse. Pollution can be super close to an area, meaning that an area is always having pollution. So that is bad for people because that can also mean that pollution is increasing where you are, not decreasing. Additionally, smog and pollution are not just dangerous to people they are also dangerous to animals. Animals use the enviornment to eat and sleep. If the environment around the animals is having pollution then that will also affect the animals. So you need to watch out for animals and not have alot of smog. Lastly, smog affects human-made buildings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, smog dosen't just affect nature around but buildings as well. In an area if that area has a place with lots of tall buildings and factories then they probably have a smog cloud above the buildings and aroud the factories. If a place has that then pollution needs to be reduced, all the buildings and factories need to be removed and the place can be another nature place again. If there is already smog or even a smog cloud by the buildings then you need to remove the buildings from the area. You need to limit where the pollution is and remove the stuff that is increasing the pollution. For example, in the article by CBS News, \"a smog-eating tower cleans 30,000 cubic meters of air each hour in 247 day year.\" This is good for the environment because the pollution is decreasing by this engine of a building.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, smog is not just bad for people but it is bad for the evironment. You need to limit your interaction with the enviornment when there is alot of pollution. Like I had said before, if there is pollution by a place like a car or anything with pollution, you need to remove that area from where you are. That way the building or area with lots of pollution can have less pollution. You need to reduce, reuse, and recycle the pollution.\n",

The last reason is other natural sites that have the same size and looks like the face on Mars. The face on Mars reminds the Auroth of a place in Idaho. It is a Butte in the Snake river Plain. It is almost the same size and shape.\n",

      "In conclusion the face of Mars is a natural site, and not made by aliens. I know because of the picture of the face of Mars. The new technology we used to get a better look at it. Lastly how other natural sites look like the face of Mars.\n",

      "generated data I agree with everything but the fact that wasting money on a car just to drive it once a month is a problem, it should only be a few weeks where that is true. Limiting car usage has become a very popular and good thing to do. There are four very good reasons as to why limiting car usage is a very good thing to do, but one of them is also very bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first very good reason as to why limiting car usage is that it would reduce inner city air pollution. In the documentary by Gary Hustwit it is stated that !\"That urban car culture is destroying the environment,overtaking from the industry\". This is a very good point that is trying to persuade you to buy in to no new car day. This should be an official American holiday so that people must leave thier cars at home and not be able to drive on this day. It would be just like christmas where teen's would have to walk to school and parents walk or carpool going to and from work. Studies in los angelas has shown that more space hinder more cars. Which means that less space will mean no cars. A study in stubenville ohio said that in 2000 they had 2,000 people from 2000 to 2010 they were wanting to increase car usage, but instead there was a 50 percent decrease and gm had to close thier plant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second very good reason as to why limiting car usage is that it would decrease the average time for people in traffic. Within a few years Paris will be rid of all cars because it is going to increase pedestrian and public spaces. They said that \"Paris is full of innovation,and also limiting the automobile has been a big part of the mayors plan to improve the cities environment and livability. Meanwhile in Houston they were boosting thier car culture with bigger roads so more people would be on thier roads. But a judge ruled that thier car convienent was was unconstitutional as to not a thing anymore. But the fact that people bought fewer cars which was what the car makers wanted decreased because of this \"recession that has had a profound change in Americas driving habits. People are more willing to bike or walk or take public transtit, especially young people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The third very good reason ass to why limiting car usage is that it would also decrease fuel usage. In the articles it says \"The fact that we have had an actual reduction in driving in each of the last several years cannot be explained solely by economic factors\". Even though reducing fuel usage would be saving money it would also make the earth a better place. In Japan it is to expensive to own cars so it is wayical to have to bus ride. Another really cool example is that in dauhli china car are totally banned from thier cities and they have had a strong increase in people using the 17 public bus routes that they have.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth and final reason that limiting car ususage should increase is that there would also be a decrease in the number of accidents including injuries and deaths. The fact that reducing the number of cars in a city would help the environment is shown when it says \"We are running out of nature,acreage is decreasing for almost everyone\". In the section under number of accidents it states \"Bogata now has a well-regarded bus system and a network of bike paths. There are still some projects to complete,like rebuilding homes by a new bikeway. But many residents say the improved life so far is worth the pain of the transition. We used to go outside and breathe, someone with asthma says, but we would vomit because of the stench. Now you can take a deep breath, and it is very pleasant. All of what they did in bogata was well worth it because people are starting to like it and it is getting better and more easy for the people of that country.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are four good reasons as to why limiting car usage was a very good thing. The reasons are that it reduce inner city air pollution, decrease the average time people have being in traffic, decreases the amount of fuel that people are using, and it also decreases the amount of accidents. But remember also that there is one bad thing about all of what I just said that it goes back including driving once a month, and driving each year during this contest that Peyfon talks about in her articl.HandlerFuncing Driving.\n",

      "real_data \"But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling\", quote from the excerpt \"The End of Car Culture\", explains that people in the United States have started to become less dependent on cars. Not only Americans, but people all around the world such as people from Germany, France, etc. Reasonings for the recent drop in car usage is that there are problems with air pollution, bikes and other transportations that do not involve the use of cars also give place more space to make more town centers and sports complexes, and cars can be a very difficult machine that causes many problems for people everyday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smog has become a very big problem for France. France has blamed diesel fuel as the reason for the smog problems. Diesel is favored more than gasonline due to a tax policy, diesel makes up over 67 percent of vehicles in France. The smog in France was so heavy that it, \"rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world\" according to an article by Robert Duffer. Smog is a very big issue that should not be taking place it can cause many health problems. France decided that the smog was getting out of hand so they began a \"Car-free day\", this meant that people would not be using their cars for a whole day and some people would not agree with this idea. France started these \"Car-free days\" with the people who had even numbered license plates and then the next day would have cars with odd numbered license plate would not drive their cars. The consequence for not following this rule was a $31.00 or 22-euro fine. Many people were fined the next few days and twenty seven people had their cars impounded due to their reaction of the fine. This \"Car-free day\" helped to reduce the smog problem in France.\n",
      "\n",
      "When people use any type of transportation other than a car they would be able to have many more places to go and have a good time. When people are using cars and other motor vehicles they are also causing more and more construction for new roads and places for cars to be able to park. If people rode bikes and walked more than we would have more places for people to build shops and complexes that are all together and easy to get to. In Vauban, Germany most residents there live a life without the use of cars. \"The streets of Vauban are completely \"car-free\"- except the main thoroughfare\", stated in the Article by Elisabeth Rosenthal. Only 30 percent of people in Vauban's familys own cars, the other 70 percent do not own cars. More than half of that 70 percent sold their cars just to live in Vauban. In Vauban they have begun to create more sidewalks that are better accesible for bikes and walking. This has created more room for people to construct new stores and places that are walkable distance for citizens, so less car usage could lead to many new places such as shops, stores and even new sports complexes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cars can be very difficult machines that cause many problems for people everyday. They can just stop in a matter of seconds and people would not know what happened, causing people to get their cars checked out at a car-shop and paying more money to get the problem fixed. If people began walking or using bikes as transportation they would not only be saving money but would lower the problems they would be having getting to and from places. Not using cars can save so much money for people because they would not have to pay much gas and they would not have to go to get their cars fixed almost every year. Even with bikes there might be a problem such as getting a flat tire or the chain popping off, even those little things would cost only a few dollars where as a trip to the car-shop would cost a least $100.00 out of pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "Limiting the use of cars can potentially save places from smog and more air pollution. Not using cars as much can leave more space for places to be built, instead of using the space as a parking lot people could use that space as a place for shopping or sports complex. Car-free day could even be a very helpful idea that might change the peoples minds to use other types of transportations besides a car. Having no cars could save a numerous amount of money for a lot of people. They will save money by not having to get a lot of gas and they will save money on not having to fix their cars almost every year. So limiting the use of cars could become a potential idea that can help people around the world.\n",

      "Should we get rid of the amazing and tech savvy invention of the car? This topic has been a controversial soutry of dibate in the past several years, and I will explain to you why we should. Every technological advacement we have has its advantages, and disadvantages. The cars were created in the early 1900's and have been increasingly advancing with new gearboxas, faster brakes, and expanding size ever since then. The main problems aruing with the cars is the pollution, growing size, and increasing population. So, should we limit ourselves with what we are capable of inventing just to keep a dateing that has been unapprfect for years; or, should we give up a disposing of technology that has one small reason for dispostal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first subject that I will talk about is the irrefutable pollution that is caused by cars every day. If you did not know, almost if not every car, runs on gasoline. Gasoline is a highly flamable liquid that is used to power cars, but it also has its downsides much like anything else. Cars produce a good ammount of pollution evertime gasoline is burned by the engine, and this has been the number one pollutant of the air ever since the invention of the car. The United States the country that is dependant on cars for transportation, is selling 12.3 million barrels of petroleum ever few weeks. Now, we have had several ways to decrease this number, but most people hardly leave their car for any reason; they drive into work or to school, then back home into the driveway. The limiting of cars was agreed on by the people in Europe to the point of people getting rid of the cars that they already owned. According to the New York Times after the conflict between israel and Lebanon when they banned cars, they had less carner citys because not that many people live in the country and take more vacations, and cars because less people own them. The second subject to consider if you are not convinced is the unstable population. We have no more room in urban areas for larger roads, and our smaller side streets and very narrow. We are already running into many problems as is, with the increasing amount of driver distractions like texting, and people who already can't drive properly and cause crashes, and possible the roads are destroyed. America is the country that is worth trillions of dollars because we are the most wealthy, and we have the best roads. But what if our road cannot handle what it was meant for any longer, eventually so much will cause decline in the worth of the country. But, if we get rid of cars, what are we supposed to use instead? We can use possibly the greates invetion of the 21'st century, the smartphones. Already in 2011 the us got rid of the amount of cars because more and more people there want to drive less, car companies in the united states had their second worse year for selling cars, and the number of people ages 14 to 34 who did not obtain a license grew to 21 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second subject that I would like to talk to you about is the growing population reason for people who are against human cars. The ever increasing and very unstable population of the world has caused many problems. Problems that are constantly getting worse like less food availability, and more car accidents. The problems are becoming more apparent, and we need a longer term solution to solve them, Before the effects become near unbearable, or cause the extinction of some living species. In not many nations across the world will you see people riding in a car, they will  see you walking from one place to another. In some countires car are ben because either the advantage of getting rid of them is too high, or because of the amount of injuries and deaths that occur from car wrecks.\n",
      "\n",
      "﻿ In conclusion, with the amount of good things to come from removal of cars much exceed the low amount of bad things. Countries all around the earth are removing the use of certain things, using more of the use of others just to either make profit or get away from some trouble. But did you know one of the wealthiest countries in the world France has made it illegal to drive cars in a new town called Viaganino? You cant keep going with everything that has been created over all the years we have had, somethings have to go, and in this cade the cars should.\n",

These past years a lot of teenagers were killed because of people using their phones while driving. Most people think they know how to text and drive but they don't. I don't think people should use their phones and drive even if they think they know how to, anything can happen in a split second.\n",
      "\n",
      "Texting & driving is more debilitating to your reaction time than driving while under the influence of alcohol. As crazy as it sounds its true people tend to crash more likely while using a device and driving than under the influence. We are so focused on social media or other people texting us that most of the time we aren't paying attention to the road. Even if you're at a red light and you use your phone your still most likely to crash because of the fact of the fact that you're not aware when the light turns green. If you simply cannot resist the urge to check messages or talk on the phone while driving, take the time to pull off of the roadway and park your vehicle before picking up your cell phone.\n",

Although, most people drive around in cars they are oblivious to the harm they are inticating such as evironmental pollutants. Though society has become reliable on cars the lack of usage of cars cound decrease the injured accident rate and reduce the tension of having smooshed cars and also might increase the physical activity of indivisuals that are remaining healthy by excericing daily. So, depending on your perspective you can criticize the driving ban or you can apprectiate finding the strong and weak sides of banning driving of cars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Categroizing and banning the use of certain things can be appreciatied or it can be disliked. Regarding some people about the ban of the driving car they were displeased due to the fact that people were having to take public transportation even though the most individuals that went on the busses had to deal with teh crowds. But, the people that fail to notice the positive aspects were focusing on the negative parts of the ban including the huge traffic that resulted in some parts of certain areas they called a \"carmaggedon\" an example could be an average Los Angelos inhabitat. Comparatively, the ban could have the same results as it did in a French city who went from deting daily fines from having the ban to ending the driving ban due to people were complaining about the fine of  \"32 Euros\". Thus, just like the French city a caution driving ban could be criticized and stopped because of what transpired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course there are many valid points of reasonong to the driving ban of cars, but there can always be another side of the reasoning that we do not tend to observe. For instance, there are various positive aspects of the driving ban that the visitors and residentsof Paris did not even notice due to their excitable emotions of receiving a fine for not using their cars. However, in Paris the percent of the inhabitants who commonly used their cars dropped from fifty nine percent to 45 percent in peak driving period and the amount of cars had a significant decrease of 225,000 during the campaign and about 363 people received a warning and had to pay a 22 euro fine. Although it may not mean the same in Paris, over the course of month or year for French residents they could reflect upon what had happened in the society as a whole they could strive for change and become a society that Amercians would enjoy. To sum it up, there are various substantial reasons for why there was a a driving of carban including the percentage of peolpe commonly using cars decreased, the amount of cars in Paris decreaed and the people of Paris was changing to become a better society by reflecting on our society as Americans.\n",

      "Ending the driving of cars there are numerous strong reasons, however the means one may percieve the reasoning depends on them and their experiences due to the fact taht different people look at occurences at a variance.

More than half of the people in the house are rushed to the hospital. As you can see there has been an atrocious accident because of that vehicle. Their should definitley be a limiting of car usage because their would be less car accidents , people would be able to spend less money on cars and we would have less air pollution. Also having a car can cause a lot of stress or tension for people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously we're having a lot of problems with money in this world , if we limit car usage that would really help is us out a lot. See as it states in source one paragraph two '' A car-owner buys a space, for forty thousand dollars , along with a home.'' With those forty thousand dollars you can do a lot to help the world . It aslo says that fifty seven percent of the people who live in a suburban area sold their cars just move where they live at now.

Paris has more smog than other European capitals so if they don't stop the smog it's going to be horrific for their city.

Also when people are honking they don't realize that other people are sleeping . Everyone needs sleep , some people can't sleep through everything so all it takes is one honk and bam they're awake. Sleeping is really needed in your life imagine notgetting enough sleep because of traffic well yeah that would suck an a lot of people already go through that .\n",

Air pollution is very bad for the world with les cars that will stop as well. Traffic is not good for the world either because it is stressful an it is not good for people to be stressed.\n",

Veracruz, Mexico is where the people from the Twilight movies lived and the place is known for its significant contact with the vast regions of Mesoamerica. Cahokia is like Witch Creek, a disadvantage of one category and upstander of the other.

They had monumental buildings,some of which were on the scale of the Maya or ancient Egyptians. They had social complexity and exlarged trade that was reflected in the presence of elite personages and their goods, such as embanted warriors. The population of Cahokia was larger than London at the time. The manmade North American old is not disease free.

From one of there examples, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venuss surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions, meaning it is possible to find research. Research is our only way of getting data proven in Paragragh six stating \"researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance.

Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

There is very little detail left on the Venus of Willendorf giving the theory a large amount of Eleanor of other theories.\n",

      "It's obviously hard to tell whether this work of art is African or another race but with the given information on it being African, it justify's that the Venus of Willendorf is African made. The reason its seen to be African is because of the neck of what supposed to be the head, the practice of elongating the neck is a type of tradtion which is actually practiced in parts of modern-day Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have seen this practice on a Tanzanian tribe, The Padaung of Burma where the women Wrap copper coils around their necks to elongate them and to us it is seen as beautiful where others may think the opposite. Despite the opposing views in beauty, cultures around the world still have practices that are the same as the others.\n",

      "Knowing this as common knowledge that different people in different cultures practice similar customs, it helps us justify whether this work of art is made by African's. Meaning it justifiy's to side with the fact that the Venus of Willdendorf is African made.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this being an African sculpture, there is a higher chance of it being discovered in Lespugne of Africa. Others may argue that it still could've been taken to this Island or another part of Africa but it' proven to be difficult to move ancient relics like the Venus of Willendorf because it's not worth the money it would cost to move it from one location to another.\n",

      "So in order for it to have moved, it would have had to been part of a much larger migration of people, but because it was carried along on beach vacation's makes it less likely to have possibly moved the Venus of Willendorf to Lespugne or Africa.\n",

      "In conclusion, because of the fact that it's hard to move precious relics like the Venus of Willendorf, and common knowledge of people in other cultures being influenced by the practices of other cultures proves that the Venus of Willendorf is indeed an African made sculpture.\n",

For example, emotions are hidden by certain people or even people that don't show emotions at all. To support my claim is that no matter if parents or anybody tells them something they will not show any type of emotion any type of way, so they use equipment or something such as the FACS technology program.\n",

It is common knowldge that the Earth is in a state of self-destruction, with humans pouring in incredible amounts of greenhouse gases into it. A high percentage of these harmuful emissions come from cars and other gas-powered vehicles. If car usage was limited, a much healthier Earth would result. According to the article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" passenger cars were responsible for 12 percent of grenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and nearly 50 percent in highly congested cities across the  United States. With this in mind, cutting these numbers down, even if only in half, would bring about such prosperity to the environemnt that benefits would soon be noticed. These figures show that the reduction of car usage is pivotal in the fight to protect the environment. Also in the article \"Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog\" it is said that car usage became so heavy in Paris that it developed insane amounts of smog, rivaling that of Beijing, which is one of the most polluted cities in the world. Clearly the root of the problem for Paris was the abundance of car usage, which once limited, reduced the smog greatly. This proves that cars can be a huge problem for the environment, but limiting the usage will have near immediate benefits. Again the environmental benefit of limiting car use is seen in the article \"The End of Car Culture.\" The article states that a limit to car usage would \"have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's eissions.\" This article does not only say that cars are  large part of pollution, but it also directly claims that less usage would be good for the environment. Limiting car usage is very important to maintaining the Earth as it is now. It is gradually becoming more and more polluted, and the limiting of vehicle use can stop that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the convenience of the car, it is such a harm to the enironment that its limiting of usage is absolutely neccesary. Several exmaples point out that cars are one of the biggest means of pollution, as it seems everyone is always drving them. Limiting car usage is one of the best things that can be done to save the environement. It is obvious that the preservation of our planet is far more important than the convenience of turning a five minute walk into a short one minute trip. With the ecological benefits of the limit of car usage, this limit of usage is defnitly advantageous.\n",

Car-free days are starting to become available at some places in the United States and some areas in Europe. Many disruptions and benefits can come from limiting the use of cars worldwide. The advantages include lower air pollution, decreased roadway fatalities and more physical fitness. While the disadvantages consist of difficult shopping and more time consumed in commuting.\n",

      "Air pollution is reduced with the limitation of people who use cars. In some places in the world they've created a policy, \"Paris has banned driving in the past because of smog, although this year the clean air... even without the partial driving ban... improved 20 percent, due to more telecommuting, car pooling and vacation during the spring sprot. \" According to an article in The New York Times.

Roadway Fatalities were decreased with the limitation of vehicular activities all around Bogota. In 1992 deaths due to traffic accidentes were reduced by about 50%. \"Traffic violence also dropped by almost 50 percent in Bogota... according to a spokesman, Jean-Paul Rasse, more than 1,100 citizens have been killed this year and over 30,000 iunjured - a slight drop from last... \" As said in an article in the New York Times.\n",

People in the col-de-saxoner area of the Swiss Alps had to come up with new plans to get to work, school, the store, etc. because of \"No Car day in the... area, undeveloped in the Swiss Alps, offering half-off on ski-lifts.\" A 1, 492 foot altitude decrease happened in the self transport race. The bathroom is a very common place to get injured, also a lot of the time it's because of the slipping that occurs ususally when entering the tub. A greater chance of slipping occurs during car-to-bathroom travel, which happened only in France becasue of car-free day, people had to walk, or ride bikes to tMinMax.net they couldn't drive their cars. T-MinMax is known as WAlmart in France.\n",

The amount of deaths by car accidents with limited car-use could be greatly reduced as well. Overall I believe this would be an amazing idea to put it to use throughout the world! It's a great way not only to make places look new again, but to also improve peoples effiecenty and effict, also to help the environment. I know I've seem some places and they honestly look horrible reven if they weren't, so it's just a first impression sort of thing. Reading these disadvantages wasn't a shocker at all I know cars are a very common source of air pollution and a big source of mortality and injury rates all around, it would help a large amount of places.\n",

      "real_data In my opinion, I don't think that you should use technology to read emotions for classes. I think that because the students should know whether someone is sad, happy, or angry even if it's hard to tell. They should not use technology to tell someone emotions, that means that they're going to use that technology more and more and it could either damage the future or probably fix the future but I think that they shouldn't use it. For people that can't tell how someone is feeling, it can be harderfor them to tell because even though that technology is in one class, it could be in any class and people that don't know how to tell emotions, it can get harder for them because all they can remember is looking at the computer and not looking at an actual person face figuring out how they feel. It shouldn't be in classes because it'll most likely cause problems for people who have trouble seeing emotions and causing peopleto use it more insread of looking at someone's face and saying that it's hard to tell either if they're sad or angry.\n",

      "Technology is big nowadays, which mean more and more new inventions would come into the future. Yes, this invention can work pretty good but it can also cause problems. Just by looking at the muscles of the human face on a computer doesn't mean you can tell that one person is angry or happy, there's so many emotions in one person and you can guess angry but instead they're sad. I think that students in class that has this technology should look at people's faces and tell if they're sad or happy. The Mona Lisa is an amazing example, it's hard to tell if she's either mad or happy, and instead of using technology to figure that out, look at her face and see if she's either angry or happy.\n",

      "If this technology is in every class, then student's would just guess based on that technology to see if someone is happy or sad.

Absolutely not, I'll just look at their and see if they're sad or not.

On pages 26 and 27 of the November 1998 issue of VAN, you will find photos of the Ausurian stones taken by the Austrian author known as Robert Bauval. These photos were paired with another photo, and from this, people have discovered the face is not a supernatural structure created by aliens past ancestors but instead an illusion created by light and shadows.\n",

Amusingly enough, there are no ancient Egyptian structures of any kind in the Usurian Syatem. Most incridbly is that the supposive \"astronaut\" is a mere 65 meters or 210 feet-assuming he's an average male-from the abstract art. On another interesting note, the picture of the Cygnus constellation that \"matched\" the \"faciale\" is not correct.

      "The age of technology is upon humanity and is affecting the species far more than anyone has expected. With more modernized devices being released at such a fast pace, it is not likely that one human of five will not have one. Technology, especially the usage of smart phones, has become ultimately distracting to humans. Operating a vehicle, however, is not the time to be distracted. Any driver, no matter the experience or skill, should not be able to use a cellular device while operating a motor vehicle because it is hazardous to themselves and others, and it is a leading cause of death.\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin with, the distraction of a cellular device is most dangerous to the driver. Not only are they putting their life on the line to send a text or view a snapchat, they are also putting their license up for suspension and possible jail time because it is an illegal activity. Any impairment of a driver is an illegal act and can be tried in the court of law.\n",
      "\n",
      "These drivers willingly know the consequences when they pull out their phone. It is important that the driver adhere to the responsibility bestowed upon them for the safety of themselves and others. Any mistakes made while moving are solely the driver's fault. A text or a call cannot amount to the value of a life, and the act of texting while driving is just as dangerous as drinking and driving. In other words, it would be thought that driving while using a phone would be less of an issue. However, it is one of the number one causes of death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the management of a cellphone while driving is one of the main causes of death today. These on-going issues have led to \"1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving.\" (The National Safety Council Texting and Driving Statistics - Distracted Driving).\n",

      "\n",
      "With such high stats, humans have began working to fix this matter in question. Many modern cars have come out with Bluetooth in the radio system which assists the driver with using his or her phone without actually using their phone. Bluetooth allows drivers to play music, text, and call all with minimal work applied. This update in technology can be seen as a breakthrough in modern advancements; but, it also has its faults that come along with it.\n",

      "While managing to make the Bluetooth setting work, drivers can also find themselves just as distracted. Losing focus for five seconds or more on the road increases the risk of accidents and injuries.

Being a hazard on the road makes a hazard for everywhere around it. In this period of time, humans are developing technology to prevent this topic from happening in the future; however, until fully preventable, it should not be permitted.\n",

      "The world has been struggling with pollution for quite some time now and has been trying to come up with ways to cut it down. So why not start with where it derives from the most? Cars. Pollution by cars got so bad in Paris that they had to use license plate numbers to decide what cars could drive on certain days! But what did happen was \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog.\" (Duffer). That is amazing! Just five days of less car usage and the smog went down 60 precent. Pollution would drop in great precentages if we just cut down car usage a bit. Pollution will always be harmful to the world, but steps should be taken to harm the world as little as possible.\n",

      "Stress is something everyone experiences, but it is safe to say that everyone could do with less of it. Cars cause lots of stress to humans. A city in Germany does not allow cars and a women from the city says \"When I had a car I was always tense.\" (Rosenthal). She is much more relaxed now and does not need to worry about all the stress that comes along with owning a car. Another person from Bogota, Columbia, where they have a car-free day, says \"Its a good opportunity to take away stress...\" (Selsky). People all around the world are reporting that their lives are a lot less stress free when they do not own cars. Stress is something that can be very damaging to a human when in large amounts and just cutting down on driving takes away lots of that stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone has been stuck in traffic from time to time, and for some people in small cities, five minutes could be a long time to be stuck in traffic. But for some people in big cities like New York City and Los Angelos, people waste hours stuck in traffic! When you accumulate all those hours stuck in traffic, that is a lot of your time wasted in just waiting to get from desitination A, to destination B. Those hours could be spent on actually being there in the moment at the destination you want to be at. \"A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.....\" (Rosenthal), many people now-a-days just want to get to the place that they are going to, as fast as possible; whether that be by car-pooling, taking the bus, or biking. Car usage is already decreasing, but that advantage should be taken that people want to live in the moment more and car usage should be even more cut down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Car usage may never be completely taken away, but it defintley can be lowered. The advantages and benefits of just less car usage is astonishing. Less pollution to help the world, less stress to help the people, and letting people live life in the moment more are all advantages the derive from cutting down on the usage of cars. It may be diffcult to let go of something many people hold on to so dearest, but it is a change the will benefit us. While cars may have its pros, its cons outweigh it in the end.\n",

There are a couple of reasons to proved this as stated in the article. One reason is the contant foaming mist that creates a sound so deafening that it prohibits normal conversation.  Another reason is that the falls still produces grand amounts of energy and that it has never been intended as a major source of power. The final reason is that poeple still gather around to see the falls majestic beauty.\n",

Poarmistress Dr. Kris Zacny had  this to say,\"They're incredible. I mean, of course, they have height and power, which is extremely impressive, but the main thing is the enormous amount of mist;that's my main focus. Because of that mist, it makes it very hard ot see the falls, very hard to see anything down there. And for me it waws very difficult to  gauge it. People who are able to look at the falls would see that it's very intimidating.\" He also said that it was intimidating because he was unable to see the entire 2,200-foot stretching of the falls. Dr. Zacny woudla returned to the falls so he could stuudy the moss found in the area for its possible life on other planets. But he would have to wait another 20 years for the roads to be cleared again of the anrdors that caused the closing of the bridge.\n",

In past situations people would build cities such as Fimont and fronteac int he early 20th century as bases to see the glory of the falls. But in the end they did nothing producing power and was abondoned after commerce, war and comparison to the great cities of norht America. And people such as Al Vaorin of Levittown, Pennslyvania would come to the falls because of his great interest in it. Vaorin was quoted to have this to say,\"I've been here many times. It's a great escape. It's so powerful, the beauty of it. I'm a big fan of natural things like the Grand Canyon. I guess I'm just somebody who is fascinated by God's creation. And that's what the falls is for me. A lot of people don't see it that way because it's kind of a disaster what happened with the place becoming abondaned.

      "Everyone has their own opinion in the use of technology based on facial expressions. In my opinion, I believe reading emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. This can be taught as if you we're being instructed by math. You may be thinking to yourself \"How can this be possible for a computer to be recognized by a facial expression?\" According to the passage, the computer process begins using a 3-D computer model of the face. The appromixate number of 44 muscles must move just like a human. A man, Dr. Paul Eckman created six different emotions such as, happy, surprised, angry, sad, fear, and disgust. Then each characteristic would be assocaiated by the moventment of the facial muscles.\n",

You can tell the difference of a person's face of how they're feeling just by looking at their face. But they might alsp, have other feelings within inside them. The new software stories similar anatomical information as an electic code.\n",

I believe that the popular vote should decide who is the president.\n",

This could cause riots and prawns around the United States.\n",

      "Two, Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the winnertakeall system. What this means is that candidates are not going to focus on the staes that they know they wont get any votes from. for example in source tw, during the campaign of 2000, seventeen states were not visited by either candidates so they didn't get to see any campaign ads. this is unfair because it makes it harder, almost impossible for these states to choose on who to vote for because they had no presentations to choose from. this puts to much power in the candidates hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some may believe otherwise. For example, since the Electoral votes are from very experienced people that have put there life and time into knowing about what is right and wrong. they are much more experience than the normal citizens. Also Electoral College prevents runoff elections to occur. for example in source three, the electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes casted. This causes lots of pressure which would greatly complicate the presidential election process. With Electoral Collage, this produces a clear winner.\n",

It would make us more money because they are not spending so much on gas, and components to keep the car in condition to drive. \"recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by\" 29 This is saying that people are not on the road alot, and if people arent on the road alot, they are not spending money. Not only does it save money on cars, but it helps you use other ways to get to places that arent expensive. It isnt expensive because people can find alternatives that dont need gas, and so much maintance. \"In a program that's set to spread to other countires, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday..\" 20 This is saying that because they dont need to use cars and there are differerent routes to take, the need to spend money on transportation decreases. Money is important to gets the necessities we humans need, so saving is a big deal.\n",

      "Rosenthal and Selsky tells us about how using less cars will benefit our environment. It would better the environment because people will learn to communicate better. \"Likewise the rise in cell phones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of share can services for getting to work.\" 35 This is saying that people learn how to share and to help one another out. Not only does it help communication, but it also helps helps people get outside and be active. It helps people get active because is they dont have cars, they have to keep themselves occupied or if they want to get to places, they have to walk, bike, etc. \"Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city: uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks..\" 28 This is saying that that the city is working with the people to help make the environment a better place with no cars. The environment is an important factor as well because we have to take care of the place we live in.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, Rosenthal, Selsky, and Duffer have shown that the reduction of the usage of cars will help us tremendously, and that having a healthier life, a greater amount of money, and a better environment will change the world.\n",

      "real_data Dear Senator, What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you think of the Presidential elections? Do you think about the complicated electoral college or the popular vote? As an average citizen who is not in politics i immediately think of the popular vote when it comes to the Presidential elections. Why do we have the electoral college anways? Shouldn't the people be able to decide who the president is not the state legislature.\n",
      "\n",
      "SO therefore instead of the electoral college we should just stick to the popular vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an American you have certain unalienable rights, and the act of voting is one of them. So if its our right to vote than we should be able to do it not other people. The electoral college isnt that safe either. In 1960 as stated in the text, when President Kennedy ran for office segregationist in the state of Louisiana nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic voters elected by the people with voters who would have voted against Kennedy. Or in 2000 when Al Gore won the popular vote but George W. Busch won the electoral vote and caused the biggest election scandal of the century. These are just a few examples of instances where the majority has won but the electoral college has caused an issue in the election. I am unsure of your preferences over popular or electoral but who the majority of the American people decide should become the President. We shouldnt allow some 538 politicians out of some 3 million citizens to choose the President. The American people should choose all of us not 538.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though our founding fathers decided that we needed a system to decide the President instead of letting the people decide times have changed. Scandals have taken place, and issues have risen. But yet we still use this process even though we have an election all it does it we elect a select few to represent us. Why cant we just pick right away? The Constitution of the United States of America is based off of a democracy where the people run the government through our elected officials. Nowhere does it say that we elect people to elect the president. That doesnt sound like the country electing the president it sounds like a few \"qualified people\" electing the president.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Senator I ask you that you make a motion to eliminate the electoral college. All it does is take away our rights as citizens to elect our officials. It has caused many scandals as well. So please I hope you can agree that we need to eliminate the electoral college and only use the popular vote.\n",

    "hypothesis = \"When you think about all the necessary parts that our society is made of in order for it to function, an unexpected image might come to your mind: a classroom. Education is not only a building process of knowledge, but it is the cornerstone of development and limitless progress. In fact, this road to innovation and the grounding for all future successes begins at the same, monotonous place where you learn your ABCs. The twenty-six letters of our alphabet are the same ones that allow you to learn and think critically. Thinking is what allows us to go beyond the status quos and what permits us to find new methods to almost every diverse obstacle. But, with the increasing advancements in the modern world, is education still as important as it was in the past? The answer is quite simple, Absolutely! Imagine for a moment what your life would be like if you couldnt read, or write, or even process new information. In just that instance alone, the world would seem so much smaller than what it is today. The seemingly universal language that is formed by most individuals, spoken words, only covers a small percentage of the global population. From your first steps, to your first day of high school, and even your first job, you use a form of communication to express your thoughts and feelings on a certain subject. Thinking critically often helps you form an opinion or stance on an issue, and then, communication steps in. You are then able to express to others your thoughts and ideas, and expand upon them. Without thinking and talking about something, an idea is just that, an idea, a figment of our imaginations that was never given the light of being a reality. Now imagine if the idea was a solution for climate change or a ground-breaking innovation that would advance society at a level never dreamed before. Without critical thinking and the ability to communicate those thoughts education, these ideas and many more would be forever lost to ignorance. The false perception that education holds little value in comparison to more seemly important issues is a grave disease that manifests itself in impoverished fields and unreached places throughout the world. This disease is an epidemic that is stopped by one thing, the very thing it often hinders, education. Education is the souls sustenance. Education empowers you to empower others. But of course, society is always searching for the bell of innovation, that awakens the sleeping giant that is success. If that be true, how do you always achieve innovations and improvements? Is it through the construction of high tech laboratories or the secrets that are held within the walls of Silicon Valley? Yes, those do aid in the advancement of society, but they are not the root of the development that we all seek. Inside each and every one of you, there are an abundance of actions and decisions that are just asking to change and better the world. Education is just the chisel to help whittle away the excess marble to uncover the hidden statue that is positive change. And like any artist will tell you, to create appealing art, the chisel must be sharp, and one must be educated in their craft. Even those who aspire to become entrepreneurs must first embrace the empowering qualities of education, before they can even begin to think about becoming a Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg. Just like a dwarf planet is still a planet, limitless progress must first conquer the roadblocks that are ignorance, and replace them with the very steps that will pave the road to advance. Education is not only the weight upon our youthful shoulders, it is the bridge whose construction will interconnect the different sectors of the world, such as poverty reduction and gender equality, into a sustainable, innovative society. A society that is more than just educated, but is an education.\"\n",
    "reference = \"Title: The Power of Education\\n\\nEducation is a fundamental pillar of society, providing individuals with the tools and knowledge necessary to lead fulfilling lives. Its impact extends far beyond classroom walls, shaping not only individual lives but also the development and progress of nations. The power of education lies in its ability to empower individuals, eradicate ignorance, foster critical thinking, and drive positive change.\\n\\nFirstly, education empowers individuals by equipping them with essential skills and knowledge. It provides the necessary tools to navigate the complexities of the modern world and enhances one's ability to make informed decisions. Education empowers individuals to pursue their passions and interests, opening up a world of possibilities and opportunities. It enables individuals to secure better employment prospects, achieve economic stability, and contribute actively to their communities.\\n\\nFurthermore, education is the key to eradicating ignorance and challenging prejudiced beliefs. It exposes individuals to a diverse range of perspectives, cultures, and ideas, enabling them to develop a broader understanding of the world. This exposure promotes tolerance, empathy, and acceptance, fostering a more inclusive and harmonious society. By dispelling ignorance, education stands as a powerful force against discrimination, bigotry, and social inequality.\\n\\nMoreover, education fosters critical thinking, enabling individuals to question and analyze the world around them. It encourages individuals to develop an inquisitive mindset, seek knowledge beyond curriculum boundaries, and form their own opinions. Critical thinking equips individuals with the capacity to challenge existing norms, address complex issues, and find innovative solutions. It is through education that societies cultivate the next generation of thinkers, leaders, and problem-solvers.\\n\\nLastly, education drives positive change on both an individual and societal level. As educated individuals contribute to their communities, possessing the knowledge and skills to tackle social and economic challenges, they become agents of progress. Education is a catalyst for socio-economic development, fostering innovation, entrepreneurship, and sustainable growth. It plays a pivotal role in reducing poverty, improving healthcare, and promoting gender equality.\\n\\nIn conclusion, education has the power to transform lives and societies. It provides individuals with the means to empower themselves, eradicate ignorance, foster critical thinking, and drive positive change. As we continue to prioritize and invest in education, we can create a more equitable, enlightened, and prosperous world for future generations.\"\n",
